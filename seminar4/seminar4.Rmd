### Ideas 

- are non-rivalrous

 - not depleted by use
 
 - technologically possible to be used by any number of people at a time
 
- Leads to increasing returns to scale

 - production with rivalrous goods and ideas together exhibit increasing returns

- Necessitates imperfect competition

### Technological change

is a result of efforts by 

- researchers

- entrepreneurs

- inventors

who respond to economic incentives such as 

- tax policy,

- research funding,

- education policy,

- intellectual property rights.

With these policies one can potentially impact economic growth.

### Justifications for government involvement in innovation market?

- Knowledge spillovers

 - Other firms can copy and learn from the original research
 
 - "Even with a well-designed intellectual property system, the benefits of new ideas are difficult to monetize in full."
 
 - Marginal social benefit of innovation is greater than marginal private benefit of innovation
 
 - In the market economy, there is too little innovation
 
- Product market spillovers

 - _Business-stealing_ effect
 
 - "Inventor firms may steal market share from other firms without necessarily generating any social benefit."
 
 - In the market economy, there is too much innovation

---
### Social returns to R&D
 
 
> "As a whole, this literature on spillovers has consistently estimated that social returns to R&D are much higher than private returns, which provides a justificatin for government policy."


Lucking, Bloom, and Van Reenen (2018) estimate that, in the US 

- social returns to R&D in the United States are about 60 percent

- private returns are about 15 percent

--

### Why not just give property rights to inventors

- Patents have efficiency loss

 - enables firms to have high markups
 
- Other firms can invent around patents

---

### Failures in other markets

<br>

- Financial constraints limit innovation

- Since intellectual property is intangible, it's harder to use it as collateral 

- Equity financing has challenges:

 - You cannot reveal your innovative idea before you actually patent it
 
 - You cannot get funding if you don't explain your idea

### Summary of results

<center>
<img src="./files/table2.jpg" width="60%"/>
</center>


---
### Tax incentives

- Elasticity of R&D with respect to tax-price of R&D is about 1.

Concerns:

- relabelling existing expenditure as R&D
 
 - patenting and productivity also increases after tax credits 
  
- relocation of R&D different locations to take advantage of tax credits

 - some evidence of relocation
 
 - relocation in itself does not account for all the increase in R&D

<br>


> "Overall, the conclusion from this literature is that despite some relocation across place, the aggregate effect of tax credits at the national level both on the volume of R&D and on productivity is substantial."
---
### Patent boxes

<br>

**Patent box:** lower tax on revenues linked to patents as opposed to other revenues

- Used in 16 OECD countries as of 2017

- Firms can manipulate stated revenues from patents

- Choi (2019): 'such policies do not have on the real location or the quantity of either R&D or innovation'

<br>

> "In contrast to well-designed research and development tax credits &ndash; for which it is hard to manipulate the stated location of research labs &ndash; patent boxes should be discouraged."

---

### Government research grants

- Harder to target R&D tax credits to maximize social benefit

- Target basic R&D

- Potential crowding out of private R&D

- Or adds in to private R&D spending (crowd-in)

- Jacob and Lefgren (2011): grants produce positive but small effects on research output

- Other researchers: public R&D crowds in private R&D

- Positive impact of academic R&D on corporate patenting

- Government funding of own labs

---

### Human Capital Supply

> "Increasing the quantity of innovative activity requires increasing the supply of workers with human capital needed to carry out research, as emphasized by Romer (2001)" 

- Increase the number of individuals with STEM degrees
 - Bianchi and Giorcelli (2018): change in enrollment requirements in Italy $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ STEM graduates $\rightarrow$ more innovation
- Migration
 - Immigrants in the US make up 18 percent of the labor force over age 25
 - Immigrants constitute 26 percents of STEM workforce
 - Immigrrants own 28 percent of higher-quality patents

> "Overall, most of the available evidence suggests that increasing the supply of human capital through expanded university programs and/or relaxed immigration rules is likely to be an effective innovation policy."

- Bell et al. (2019): children born into top 1 percent income distribution is 10 times as likely to be an inventor than children born into bottom half.
 - differences in innate ability explain only a little of the discrepency
 - differentiated exposure to inventors in childhood
 - better schooling, greater exposure to inventor role models, mentoring needed
 
---

### Intellectual property

- Patents, copyrights, trademarks, ...

> "A patent grants &ndash; in exchange for disclosure of invention &ndash; a limited-term property right to an inventor, during which time the inventor has the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling their invention."

- Boldrin and Levine (2013) argue that patent system should be abolished
 - no evidence that patents increase innvation and productivity
 
- Social costs might be greater than social benefits

- Patent trolls

---

### Product market competition and international trade

Theoretical impact of competition on innovation is ambiguous.

- Competition reduces innovation
 - The reward to innovation is monopoly profits. 
 
 - Competition reduces profits and hence incentives to innovate.
 
 - Also reduces funds to finance innovation.
 
- Competition increases innovation

 - Monopolists have no incentive to innovate
 
 - An entrant has no rents to lose, so it can engage in destructive innovation
 
 - If competition reduces demand for a firm's products, it will be forced to innovate

---
### Competition
 
- Empirical evidence suggests that competition increases innovation, especially in markets with low level of competition

 - In South America, Asia and Europe, competition from China increased innovation

 - In North America, competition from China reduced innovation in manufacturing

- Increase innovation by increasing the market size

> "Greater competition and trade opennes typically increase innovation."
