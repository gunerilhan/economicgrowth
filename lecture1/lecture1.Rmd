### Questions 

- Why do countries differ in their standards of living?

- Why do countries grow richer or fail to grow richer over time?

- What are the roles of physical capital, population, human capital, ideas, basic science, and public policy for growth?

### Topics


- Facts and modern theories of economic growth

- The role of productivity on growth

- The relationship between government policies, income inequality and economic growth

### Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ##

**GDP:** Market value of all the goods and services produced in a country within a period. 

- GDP = output = income

- GDP is a rough-and-ready measure of standard of living. 

- How to compare GDP of countries with different currencies and of a single country in different years?

 -  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates: artificial exchange rates based on the prices of a standardized basket of goods and services (both traded and non-traded).

---

### GDP per capita##
GDP per capita = average income

$$ y_t = \frac{\text{total GDP}}{\text{population}} $$

- Total GDP could be large because of high average income and/or large population

- US has high GDP per capita but China and India do not

### Fact 1



- Per capita income in the poorest countries are less than 5% of per capita income in the richest countries.

- GDP per capita in 2016 (in 2011 US dollars)

$$ \frac{\text{US (\$53015)}}{\text{Iran (\$15529)}} \approx \frac{\text{Iran (\$15529)}}{\text{Moldova (\$5851)}} \approx \frac{\text{Moldova (\$5851)}}{\text{Ethiopia (\$1659)}} \approx 3 $$


- The 20% of world population that lives in the richest countries receive 60% of world income.

#### Goals

1. Provide an introduction on Python so that you can read and understand my code/solutions of the problem sets

2. Incetivize you to learn a modern programming language


#### Materail to be covered

The following lectures from https://quantecon.org/

- [<u>Python essentials</u>](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html)

- [<u>An introductory example:</u>](https://python.quantecon.org/python_by_example.html)

Overall quantecon is a great resource to learn Python.

Follow the materials here: https://python.quantecon.org/index_undergrad.html
