### Population growth rate and GDP per capita

.pull-left[
- There is a negative correlation between population growth rate and GDP per capita

- Countries like Democratic Republic of  Conge (COD) have high population growth rate and very low GDP per capita

- India and China how moderate population growth rate and middle income per capita 

- Germany, the US, the UK have low population growth rates but high income per capita

- How about Qatar (QAT)?

 - Immigration?

### Population growth in the Solow model

.pull-left[

- Law of motion for capital per worker
$$ \dot{ k} = \gamma f(k) - (\delta+n)k,  $$where $n$ is the population growth rate.

- At the steady state
$$  \gamma f(k^{\ast}) = (\delta+n) k^{\ast}  $$
- As $n \uparrow$, $k^{\ast}\downarrow$ (from $k_1^{ss}$ to $k_2^{ss}$)
 - Notice that both $k^\ast$ and $k^{ss}$ mean steady-state capital per worker.

 
- Countries with high population growth are poorer.

- Higher population growth dilutes per-worker capital stock more quickly

- Lower steady state level of output per worker

### Exercise

<br>

<br>

- Sketch a graph of (log of) capital per worker and output per worker over time with and without a decrease in the population growth rate.


---
### Solow model's predictions of income differences

- Recall income per worker of country $i$ relative to the country $j$,

$$ \frac{y_i^{\ast}}{y_j^{\ast}}= \left(\frac{A_i}{A_j}\right)^{1/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{\gamma_i}{\gamma_j}\right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{\delta_j+n_j}{\delta_i+n_i}\right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{h_i}{h_j}\right)$$
- Remember that in the Solow model income per worker ratio is equal to income per capita ratio as everyone works.

- Suppose country $i$ and country $j$ differ only with respect to their population growth rates and $\alpha=1/3$

  $A_i=A_j=A$, $\delta_i=\delta_j=\delta=.05$, $h_i=h_j=h$, and $\gamma_i=\gamma_j=\gamma$.

- Then,


$$ \frac{y_i^{\ast}}{y_j^{\ast}}= \left(\frac{.05+n_j}{.05+n_i}\right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}$$



---

### Solow model's predictions vs data

.pull-left[
- If country $i$ and $j$ differ only with respect to their population growth rates

- Substitute in average population growth rates from 1970 and 2017, and calculate actual and predicted income per capita ratios relative to the US.

- There is still a positive correlation but not very strong.

- We did not take into account:

 - Differences in investment rates
 - Differences in human capital
 - Differences in productivity
 - Employment growth rate is not equal to population growth rate in the data in cotrast to the model

### What's the unrealistic critical assumption of the Solow model in regards to population growth rate?

 - Constant population growth rate assumption of the model
 
 - Population growth rate is decreasing throughout the world

### Summary

<br>

<br>



Solow Model

- Accounts for the negative correlation of population growth rate and income per capita

 - higher population growth rate dilutes capital quickly, and hence countries cannot accumulate as much capital per worker

- Population growth rate is exogenous

- Cannot account for the reduction in population growth rate as countries get richer

### Quality of labor

<br>


<br>


- So far, we have treated quality of labor as same across countries and over time.

- Quality of labor a worker supplies depends on whether a worker is 

 - weak or strong
 
 - ill or healthy
 
 - ignorant or educated
 
---
### Human Capital

**Human capital:** Qualities of labor that

- are productive (characteristics that enable workers to produce more),

- are produced (investment in human capital),

- earns a return (higher wage for owners of human capital),

- depreciates.


Human capital can be 

- in the form of health,

- in the form of education.


<br>

#### How do human capital in the form health and in the form education affect per capita income of countries?

### Calorie intake

- In a poor country like Central African Republic (CAF) daily calorie intake per person is less than 2000

 - Half of calorie intake of Americans

### Measuring human capital

<br>


#### How can we measure human capital in a country?

1. Measure the value of spending one more year in school in different education levels

2. Characterize the distribution of years of schooling people have in a country

3. Find human capital for different education levels using step 1

4. Combining the 2nd and 3rd steps, generate a human capital index
 - Human capital index is a measure of average human capital in a country

### (Private) returns to education

_Step 1 in measuring human capital_

.pull-left[
- **Returns to education:** Increase in wages that a worker would receive if she had one more year of schooling.

 - a measure of spending one more year in school

- Estimates from Hall and Jones (1999)

 - First 4 years (grades 1 &ndash; 4): 13.4%

 - Next four years (grades 5 &ndash; 8): 10.1%

 - Beyond eight years: 6.8%

.pull-right[
<center>
<img src="./files/figure6-6.jpg" width="100%" />
</center>

]

---
### Human capital's share of wages

- 2/3 (approx.) of national income is paid to labor

- Wage is paid to the combination of the hours worked (raw labor) and their quality (human capital)

- How much is paid to raw labor?

- How much is paid to human capital?

- Suppose a worker has five years of education.

- His wage would be $1.1344^4 \times 1.101 = 1.82$ times wage of a worker with no education

- $.82/1.82 = 45\%$ to human capital, $55\%$ to raw labor

- Now, apply this method to entire labor force

### Measuring human capital

_Step 3 and 4 in measuring human capital_

How can we measure human capital in the form of education?
 $$ h = h_0 \times \left(\left( \frac{w_1}{w_0}\right)^{t_1} \times \left( \frac{w_2}{w_1}\right)^{t_2} \times \dots  \right)$$


- $h_0:$ level of labor input per worker with no schooling

- $\frac{w_i}{w_{i-1}}:$ annual wage premium paid to education level $i$ (primary, secondary, higher)

- $t_i:$ years spend in education level $i$


Then take a weighted mean of worker specific human capital to mesure average human capital in a country:

<center>

</center>

]

- Example: Percentage of people with primary education times human capital of a worker with primary education, plus percentage of people with high school education times human capital of a worker with high school degree, and so on.
 
---
### Quantitative analysis

- Recall income per worker of country $i$ relative to the country $j$,

$$ \frac{y_i^{\ast}}{y_j^{\ast}}= \left(\frac{A_i}{A_j}\right)^{1/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{\gamma_i}{\gamma_j}\right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{\delta_j+n_j}{\delta_i+n_i}\right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{h_i}{h_j}\right)$$

- Suppose country $i$ and country $j$ differ only with respect to their human capital

$$A_i=A_j=A, \text{ } \delta_i=\delta_j=\delta,\text{ } n_i=n_j=n, \text{ and } \gamma_i=\gamma_j=\gamma$$.

- Then $$\frac{y_i^{\ast}}{y_j^{\ast}}= \frac{h_i}{h_j}$$

- If we measure human capital, we can calculate income differences predicted by human capital differences using the above equation




---

### Solow model's predictions vs data

.pull-left[

- Substitute in human capital levels in 2017 into $$\frac{y_i^{\ast}}{y_j^{\ast}}= \frac{h_i}{h_j}$$

- Compute predicted income per worker ratio relative to the US for each country

- Compare predicted values with actual values from data

 - There is a strong and positive correlation (.6) between the two
 
- Human capital is a strong predictor of income differences across countries

### Exercise

Analyze the impact of an increase in human capital level in the Solow economy using a Solow diagram. Also, sketch a graph of (log of) capital per worker and output per worker over time with and without an increase in the human capital.

### Problems in comparing education levels across countries


.pull-left[
- quality of schooling might be different across countries

 - high income countries tend to have ``better" schooling

 - average years of schooling understates the difference in human capital

- externalities

 - human capital could affect technology and efficiency levels 

 - private return vs social return of education

### Summary


- Human capital in the form of health and education have positive effects on income.

- High income countries have higher years of schooling, and higher schooling quality.

- Years of schooling and quality of schooling have been improving all around the world.
