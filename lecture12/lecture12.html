---
### Defining the proper role of the government

#### The case of government intervention in the economy:

_Market failure:_

- public goods
 - non-rivalrous, non-excludable: national defense, rule of law, infrastructure

- externalities

 - social net benefit `\(\neq\)` private net benefit
 - R&amp;D subsidies
 - patents
 - education
 
- natural monopoly
 - high sunk cost: public utilities (electricities, natural gas, water, public transportation)

- coordination failure
 - industrial policy: supply chain, infant industry

---
### Defining the proper role of the government, cont'd

#### The case against government intervention in the economy:

_Government failure:_
- lack of incentives/information for the government to operate properly

 - inefficient state enterprises/government-owned banks

 - industrial policies lead to rent-seeking

- government failure `\(&gt;\)` market failure ?

 - privatization and deregulation


#### Equity-efficiency trade-off in redistribution:
- benefit of redistribution: higher equity

- cost of redistribution: lower efficiency, bureaucratic cost

## How governments affect growth

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
### How governments affect growth

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

- Rule of law

- Taxation, efficiency, and the size of government

- Planning and other industrial policies

- Preventing civil conflicts


---
### Rule of law

.pull-left[
- a reliable legal system should lead to high factor accumulation

 - without property rights no one would save/invest

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="./files/figure1.jpg" width="100%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

]

.pull-right[
- a reliable legal system should lead to high productivity

 - without contract enforcement no one would trade: no division of labor
 
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="./files/figure2.jpg" width="90%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
]

### Taxation, efficiency, and the size of government

.pull-left[
#### Wagner's law
 - the size of a government will increase as countries become richer due to more complex regulations and advanced public goods provision
 
 - increase in expenditure requires increase in taxes

#### Taxes and output

 - increase in tax rates leads to lower efficiency &lt;br&gt;
 &amp;ndash; distortionary taxes discourage economic activities &lt;br&gt;
 &amp;ndash; dead weight loss represents the efficiency loss

### Planning and other industrial policies

&lt;br&gt;

- State enterprises

- Government-owned banks

 - China: 98% of bank assets (2006)
 - India: 75%
 - Egypt: 65%
 - Israel: 46%
 - Germany: 42% 
 
- Marketing boards

- Protection of infant industries with tariffs

---

### Planning is not always a failure

- South Korea
 
 - public enterprises in steel and petro-chemicals

 - directed investment into selected industries

 -  tariffs to protect infant industries

 - public enterprises operated as autonomous, profit-seeking entities

- Taiwan

 - foreign firms were able to sell products in Taiwan only with technology transfer

 - weaned infant industries from protection

- Korea: protection conditional on growing export

- Taiwan: protection conditional on meeting productivity targets

- Planning works when administered by an efficient, honest bureaucracy

## Why governments do things &lt;br&gt; that are bad for growth

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---
### Why governments do things that are bad for growth
- Some other goals
 - national defense, arts, foreign aid
 - anti-pollution regulations

- Corruption 

 - waste of government revenue
 - lower efficiency of production
 - undertake policies solely to generate more opportunities for bribery
 - undermine rule of law
 
- Self-preservation
 - new technologies can redistribute economic power
 - rising education may introduce destabilizing new ideas
 - movement of population from farms to cities may lead to revolutionary class
 - trade carries dangerous ideas

### Government regulation: helping hand or grabbing hand
Djankov et al. (2002)

.pull-left[

- Bolivia: follow 20 procedures, wait 82 days, pay $2,696 to establish a business

- Canada: 2 procedures, 2 days, $280
- Helping hand
 - regulate entry of new firms to protect consumers from low-quality products
 - limit negative externalities such as pollution

- Grabbing hand
 - benefit government bureaucrats
 - benefit people with good connections to government

]


.pull-right[

- Data supports grabbing hand

- Countries with more regulations did not have less pollution, higher-quality consumer products, or better health

- More democratic countries tend to have fewer regulations

## Why poor countries have bad governments

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;



---
### Why poor countries have bad governments

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


- Poor countries tend to have bad governments

- Are these countries poor because of their bad governments?

- Is bad government a symptom of poverty?

---
.pull-left[
### Causation running from income to government quality

- Until 1871, British army officers were appointed and promoted by purchasing of their positions

- History of New York City, _a cesspool of corruption_

- Yet, these countries and cities are now advanced economies with better governments

- Rich countries can afford to pay their civil servants reasonable wages

- larger pie to split, less of the destructive competition
]

.pull-right[
### Causation running from government quality to income

- South Korea vs North Korea

- Some countries have bad government that have nothing to do with their income

 - (e.g. former colonies)

 - policies favoring short-run gains rather than long-run growth
]
.pull-right[
#### India vs China

- In 1980, India: $1,018 income per capita
 - China: $714 

- average growth rate, China: 1975-2009: 7.9% per year

- licensing of new investment projects

- modernizing regulations

- building infrastructure

- bickering between different levels of government

### Conclusion

&lt;br&gt;

- rule of law is unambiguously good for economic growth

- complete government direction of the economy does not work

- government planning and the protection of infant industries with tariffs have often but not always failed

- government quality and income are interrelated to each other
