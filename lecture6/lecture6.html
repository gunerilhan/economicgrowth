### Introduction

- Some aspects of factor accumulation &amp;ndash;
 - investment rate, 
 - population growth rate, 
 - human capital 
 
 &amp;ndash; explain some variation in income differences across countries.

- Taken together, do the different aspects of factor accumulation explain all of the variation among countries? 
 
 - Answer: **No**
 
- Productivity explains the remaining part of the variation among countries




---
### Productivity

- **Productivity:** Effectiveness with which factors of production are converted into output.

- Productivity = (Real) Output / Input

- Output = Nominal GDP / Price Deflator (CPI or PPI)

- Labor productivity = Output / Hours Worked

- Total Factor Productivity (TFP) = Output / Index of all inputs to production

- `\(A\)` in our Cobb-Douglas production functions is an example of TFP
$$ y = Ak^\alpha h^{1-\alpha} \Rightarrow A = \frac{y}{k^\alpha h^{1-\alpha}}$$ 
- In this module, main focus is on total factor productivity

 - When we say 'productivity', we mean total factor productivity

### Productivity slowdown

- Many advanced economies experienced slowdown in labor productivity growth in the last decade

- UK experienced one of the severest slowdown.

### Accounting exercises

- Countries differ in their output because of 

 - differences in factor accumulation

 - differences in productivity

- In this lecture, we ask:

 - How much does productivity differ across countries?
 
 - How much of the variation in income per worker among countries is explained by productivity differences?
 
 - How much does productivity growth differ among countries?
 
 - How much of the variation in growth rates among countries is explained by variation in productivity growth, and how much by variation in factor accumulation?

### Measuring productivity differences among countries

- Assume production function is a Cobb-Douglas

$$ Y = A K^\alpha (hL)^{1-\alpha}$$

- Output per worker `\(y = A k^\alpha h^{1-\alpha}\)`

- factors of production = `\(k^\alpha h^{1-\alpha}\)`

- output = productivity `\(\times\)` factors of production

---
### Productivity differences

- Output per worker of country 1 and country 2
$$ y_1 = A _1 k_1^\alpha h_1^{1-\alpha}$$
$$ y_2 = A_2 k_2^\alpha h_2^{1-\alpha}$$

- Output per worker ratios:
$$ \frac{y_1}{y_2} = \left(\frac{A_1}{A_2} \right)\left(\frac{ k_1^\alpha h_1^{1-\alpha}}{ k_2^\alpha h_2^{1-\alpha}} \right) $$ 

$$ \text{ratio of output per worker} = \text{ratio of productivity } \times \text{ ratio of factors of production} $$
- Ratio of productivity

$$ \text{ratio of productivity } = \frac{A_1}{A_2}  = \frac{\text{ratio of output per worker}}{\text{ ratio of factors of production}} = \frac{\left( \frac{y_1}{y_2} \right)}{\left(\frac{ k_1^\alpha h_1^{1-\alpha}}{ k_2^\alpha h_2^{1-\alpha}} \right)} $$

---
### Numerical example
$$ \frac{A_1}{A_2} = \frac{\left( \frac{y_1}{y_2} \right)}{\left(\frac{ k_1^\alpha h_1^{1-\alpha}}{ k_2^\alpha h_2^{1-\alpha}} \right)} $$ 
$$ \text{ratio of productivity } = \frac{ \text{ratio of output}}{\text{ ratio of factors of production}} $$


| | Output per worker, `\(y\)` | Physical capital per worker, `\(k\)` | Human capital per worker, `\(h\)` |
|:--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Country 1 | 24 | 27 | 8 |
| Country 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |


$$ \frac{A_1}{A_2} = \frac{\left( \frac{24}{1} \right)}{\left( \frac{27^{1/3}\times8^{2/3}}{1^{1/3}\times 1^{2/3}} \right)} = \frac{24}{\left(\frac{3 \times 4}{1} \right)}=2$$
- Country 1 is twice as productive as country

### Development accounting 

&lt;br&gt;

**Development accounting:** breaking down income differences into parts accounted for by

- productivity differences

- factor accumulation differences

We ask

- How much of the variation in income per worker among countries is explained by productivity differences?

- How much of the variation in income per worker among countries is explained by factors of production differences?

---
### Development accounting, algorithm


Using data in a given year, say `\(t\)`:

1. Pick a base country

2. Find output per worker of country `\(i\)` relative to the  base country, `\(\frac{y_i}{y_{base}} = ?\)`

3. Find physical capital per worker of country `\(i\)` relative to the  base country, `\(\frac{k_i}{k_{base}} = ?\)`

4. Find human capital per worker of country `\(i\)` relative to the base country, `\(\frac{h_i}{h_{base}} = ?\)` 

5. Find factors of production of country `\(i\)` relative to the base country, `\(\frac{k^\alpha _i h_i^{1-\alpha}}{k^\alpha _{base} h_{base}^{1-\alpha}} = ?\)`

6. Find productivity of country `\(i\)` relative to the base country,  `\(\frac{A_i}{A_{base}} = ?\)` 

7. Comment on the values you found in above steps

- Large differences in productivity 
 
 - 38% for Myanmar
 
 - 1.02% for Norway 
 
 - 63% for South Korea

- Canada and UK: similar output per worker hours, Canada is more productive, the UK has more factors of production.

- Japan has factors of production close to the US (92%), but is about 40% less productive than the US.

### Differences in the growth rate of productivity among countries

&lt;br&gt;

**Growth accounting:** breaking a country's growth into parts accounted for by

- growth in productivity

- growth in the quantity of factors of production

We ask

- How much income growth on average is accounted for by the productivity growth?

- How much income growth on average is accounted for by increases in factors of production?


---
### Measuring a country's productivity growth


$$ \text{output}=\text{productivity}\times \text{factors of production}$$
- growth rate of output  = growth rate of productivity + growth rate of factors of production

- growth rate of productivity = growth rate of output - growth rate of factors of production

--

- Assume a Cobb-Douglas production function

- Output per worker, `\(y= Ak^\alpha h^{1-\alpha}\)`

- Take natural log of each side of equation
$$ \ln(y)= \ln(Ak^\alpha h^{1-\alpha}) = \ln(A) + \alpha \ln(k) + (1-\alpha)\ln(h) $$

- Differentiate with respect to time
`$$\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{y} = \frac{\frac{dA}{dt}}{A}+ \alpha  \frac{\frac{dk}{dt}}{k} + (1-\alpha) \frac{\frac{dh}{dt}}{h}$$` 
$$ \hat{y} = \hat{A} + \alpha \hat{k}+ (1-\alpha) \hat{h} \Rightarrow \hat{A} = \hat{y} - (\alpha \hat{k}+ (1-\alpha) \hat{h})  $$
where `\(\hat{x}\)` is the growth rate of `\(x\)`.

### Growth accounting, algorithm

.pull-left[
For a country, `\(i\)`, from year `\(t\)` to year `\(t+n\)`, find

1. the average annual growth rate of income per worker, `\(\hat{y} = \frac{\ln y_{i,t+n}-\ln y_{i,t}}{n}\)`

2. the average annual growth rate of physical capital per worker, `\(\hat{k} = \frac{\ln k_{i,t+n}-\ln k_{i,t}}{n}\)`

3. the average annual growth rate of human capital per worker, `\(\hat{h} = \frac{\ln h_{i,t+n}-\ln h_{i,t}}{n}\)`

4. the average annual growth rate of factors of production per worker, `\(\hat{f.o.p.} = \alpha \hat{k} + (1-\alpha) \hat{h}\)`

5. the average annual growth rate of productivity, `\(\hat{A} = \hat{y} - \hat{f.o.p}\)`

]

Comment on the above stats, in particular highlight

1. percentage of output per worker growth accounted for by the productivity growth, `\(\frac{\hat{A}}{\hat{y}}\)`

2. percentage of output per worker growth accounted for by the factors of production, `\(\frac{\hat{f.o.p}}{\hat{y}}\)`

 - percentage of output per worker growth accounted for by the physical capital accumulation, `\(\frac{\alpha \hat{k}}{\hat{y}}\)`

 - percentage of output per worker growth accounted for by the human capital accumulation, `\(\frac{(1-\alpha) \hat{h}}{\hat{y}}\)`

]


---
### Numerical example

$$  \hat{A}  = \hat{y} - \alpha \hat{k} -  (1-\alpha) \hat{h} $$ 


| | Output per worker, `\(y\)` | Physical capital per worker, `\(k\)` | Human capital per worker, `\(h\)` |
|:--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Erewhon in 1975 | 1 | 20 | 5 |
| Erewhon in 2010 | 4 | 40 | 10 |
| Annual growth rate | 4% | 2% | 2% |

$$ \text{growth rate of output} = \left(\frac{\ln (\text{output in 2010}) - \ln(\text{output in 1975})}{35} \right)=.04 $$
$$ \hat{A} = .04 - \frac{1}{3} \times .02 - \frac{2}{3} \times .02 = .02$$
---
### Growth accounting for the UK

- Years 1970 &amp;ndash; 2018

- 1.85% output per worker growth annually

- physical capital stock per worker growth rate of 2.47% per year

- human capital growth rate of 0.66% per year

- `\(\alpha=1/3\)`

$$ \hat{A} = 0.0185 - \frac{1}{3} \times 0.0247 - \frac{2}{3} \times 0.0066 = 0.0058 $$

- Productivity growth explains 32% of income growth (0.0058/0.0185 = 32%)

- 68% of growth is explained by the accumulation of factors of production

### Growth accounting, further analysis
&lt;br&gt;

- Growth rate of factors of production ranges from 0.97% to 2.48% (1.51 percentage point gap)

- Productivity growth in the fastest growing one-fifth of countries is 1.25% per year

- Productivity growth in the slowest growing one-fifth of countries is -1.79% per year

- Gap between the highest and the lowest productivity growth is 3.04 percentage point

- Productivity growth is much more important source of income growth

- 71% of variation in the growth rates is the result of variation in productivity growth

- 29% of the variation is due to variation in factor accumulation

---
### Problems with measuring productivity

&lt;br&gt;

- Quality of schooling

- Misreporting of investment

- Many different types of assets

- Quality differences across different versions of same asset

- Finding appropriate weights to sum up real quantities of  different assets 

- Production function is not necessarily constant

- Factor shares vary across countries

 - productivity differences

 - factor accumulation differences

- **Growth accounting:** Breaking a country's growth into parts accounted for by

 - growth in productivity

 - growth in the quantity of factors of production
