Generate a table comparing Solow model's predicted output per worker relative to the UK with actual output per worker relative to the UK (in 2017, or in the latest available year). Hint, I ask you to do an exercise similar to what we have done in lecture 3. Briefly comment on the table.  \n",

Calculate average annual employment growth rates of the above listed countries from 1970 to 2017. Repeat the exercise in part b. Create a table that compares Solow model's predicted output per worker differences with actual output per worker differences relative to the UK. Briefly comment on the table.\n",
