### Questions

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

- What's the role of tehnological progress on economic growth?

- Do relatively low income countries grow faster than high income countries?

### Countries get more productive

.pull-left[
- TFP stands for total factor productivity

- TFP = total real output / total inputs into production
&lt;center&gt;

.pull-right[
- It does not mean that India is more productive than the US

- It means the TFP of India has grown more than the US TFP since 1956

### Is the Solow model wrong?

&lt;br&gt;

George E.P. Box:
&gt; All models are wrong but some are useful.

&lt;br&gt;

- The Solow model is _very_ useful in understanding the role of capital accumulation in short-run economic growth.

### _Extended_ Solow Model

- Also known as _the Solow model with technological progress_

.pull-left[
- Retain assumptions:

 - Constant returns to scale production function: `\(F(K,ehL)\)`
 
 - A constant fraction, `\(\gamma\)`, of output is invested.
 
 - A constant fraction, `\(\delta\)`, of physical capital stock depreciates.
 
 - Labor force participation rate is constant
 
 - Population grows at a constant rate, `\(n\)`.
 
 - Human capital, `\(h\)`, is constant.


]

.pull-right[

- Differently, assume

 - There is labor augmenting technological progress, `\(F(K,{\color{red}e}hL)\)`

 - Labor augmenting technology, `\(e\)`, grows at a constant rate, `\(g\)`.

 $$ \frac{\dot{e}}{e} = g \Leftrightarrow e(t)=e_0 \exp(gt)$$


]


---
### Clarification...
- Previously, we assumed production function is `\(AF(K,hL)\)`
 
 - Here, `\(A\)` is Hicks-neutral technology

- In the Extended Solow model, technology needs to be labor-augmenting: `\(F(K,ehL)\)`

 - Here, `\(e\)` is labor-augmenting or Harrod-neutral technology
 
- In Cobb-Douglas production, this distinction is not important.
 
 - `\(K^\alpha(ehL)^{1-\alpha} = AK^\alpha(hL)^{1-\alpha},\)` where `\(A\equiv e^{1-\alpha}\)`

---
### Accumulation of physical capital


- Change in capital stock = Investment - Depreciation
$$ \dot{K} = I - D$$

- A constant fraction, `\(\gamma\)`, of output is invested 
$$ I = \gamma Y$$

- A constant fraction, `\(\delta\)`, of capital depreciates
$$ D = \delta K$$
- Change in capital stock:
$$ \dot{K} = \gamma Y - \delta K$$
---
### Accumulation of capital-technology ratio

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


- Goal: derive a formula for the accumulation of capital-technology ratio, `\(\tilde{k} \equiv \frac{K}{eL}\)`

- Capital-technology ratio, `\(\tilde{k}\)`, sometimes referred as _capital per effective worker_. 

- Why do we need to convert physical capital accumulation equation into capital-technology units?

 - Because capital stock will grow as a result of increasing population and higher productivity.

---
### Accumulation of capital-technology ratio, cont'd


- Accumulation of capital
$$ \dot{K} = \gamma Y - \delta K$$

- How do we transform `\(\dot{K}\)` into `\(\dot{\tilde{k}}\)`?

 - make use of `\(\tilde{k}\equiv \frac{K}{eL}\)`

 - take log of `\(\tilde{k}(t)\equiv \frac{K(t)}{e(t)L(t)}\)`:

$$ \ln(\tilde{k}(t))= \ln \left(\frac{K(t)}{e(t)L(t)} \right) = \ln(K(t)) -\ln(e(t)) - \ln(L(t))  $$ 

 - Then differentiate with respect to time, `\(t\)`,

 $$ \frac{\dot{\tilde{k}}(t)}{\tilde{k}(t)} = \frac{\dot{K}(t)}{K(t)} - \frac{\dot{e}(t)}{e(t)} - \frac{\dot{L}(t)}{L(t)}, \hspace{.5cm} \frac{\dot{\tilde{k}}}{\tilde{k}} = \frac{\dot{K}}{K} - g -n \Rightarrow \frac{\dot{K}}{K} = \frac{\dot{\tilde{k}}}{\tilde{k}} + g + n  $$

 - Remember chain-rule: `\(\frac{df(g(x))}{dx} = \frac{df}{dg}\frac{dg}{dx}\)`

---
### Accumulation of capital-technology ratio, cont'd (2)

.pull-left[


- Divide each side of `\(\dot{K} = \gamma Y - \delta K\)`
 by `\(K\)`:
$$ \frac{\dot{K}}{K} = \frac{\gamma Y}{K} - \delta  $$
-  Substitute `\(\frac{\dot{K}}{K} = \frac{\dot{\tilde{k}}}{\tilde{k}} + g + n\)` into above equation,
$$ \frac{\dot{\tilde{k}}}{\tilde{k}} + g +n =  \frac{\dot{K}}{K} = \frac{\gamma Y}{K} - \delta $$
- Divide both numerator and denominator of `\(\frac{\gamma Y}{K}\)` with `\(eL\)`:
$$ \frac{\dot{\tilde{k}}}{\tilde{k}} + g +n  = \frac{\gamma Y/(eL)}{K/(eL)} - \delta $$
]

.pull-right[
- Substitute in `\(\tilde{y} \equiv \frac{Y}{eL}\)` and `\(\tilde{k} \equiv \frac{K}{eL}\)`
$$ \frac{\dot{\tilde{k}}}{\tilde{k}} + g +n  = \frac{\gamma \tilde{y}}{\tilde{k}} - \delta,  \text{ where } \tilde{y} \equiv \frac{Y}{eL} $$
- Take `\(g+n\)` to the right hand side
$$ \frac{\dot{\tilde{k}}}{\tilde{k}}  = \frac{\gamma \tilde{y}}{\tilde{k}} -( \delta+ g +n ) \hspace{.3cm} $$
- Multiply both sides with `\(\tilde{k}\)`:

$$ \dot{\tilde{k}}  = \gamma \tilde{y}-( \delta+ g +n )\tilde{k} $$


- Change in capital per effective workers is equal to investment per effective worker minus depreciation per effective worker minus capital dilution per effective worker due to population growth and technological progress.

# Steady State Analysis

### Steady State
$$ \dot{\tilde{k}}  = \gamma \tilde{y}-( \delta+ g +n )\tilde{k}, \text{ or }$$ 
$$ \dot{\tilde{k}}  = \gamma f(\tilde{k})-( \delta+ g +n )\tilde{k} $$  
where `\(\tilde{y}=f(\tilde{k}) = F(K,ehL)/(eL)\)`


Capital-technology ratio is constant at the steady state.

- if `\(\gamma f(\tilde{k}) &gt; (\delta+g+n) \tilde{k}\)`, then `\(\dot{\tilde{k}} &gt; 0\)`

- if `\(\gamma f(\tilde{k}) &lt; (\delta+g+n) \tilde{k}\)`, then `\(\dot{\tilde{k}} &lt; 0\)`

- if `\(\gamma f(\tilde{k}) = (\delta+g+n) \tilde{k}\)`, then `\(\dot{\tilde{k}} = 0\)`: **steady state**

- If `\(\tilde{k} &lt; \tilde{k}^\ast\)`, capital-technology ratio will increase. 

- If `\(\tilde{k} &gt; \tilde{k}^\ast\)`,  capital-technology ratio will decrease.

### Per worker values

.pull-left[
Output per worker:

$$ y(t) = e(t) \tilde{y}(t) $$ 
 - Recall that `$$y(t) =\frac{Y(t)}{L(t)} = e(t)\frac{Y(t)}{e(t)L(t)} = e(t) \tilde{y}(t)$$`

Capital per worker:
$$ k(t) = e(t) \tilde{k}(t) $$ 

 - Recall that `$$k(t) =\frac{K(t)}{L(t)} = e(t)\frac{K(t)}{e(t)L(t)} = e(t) \tilde{k}(t)$$`


]

.pull-right[
Output per worker at the steady state:
$$ y(t) = e(t) \tilde{y}^\ast = e(t) \left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta+g+n} \right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}h$$ 
- Since `\(\tilde{y}^\ast\)` is constant at the steady state, `\(y\)` at the steady state grows at the same rate as `\(e\)`: `\(g\)`.

Capital per worker:
$$ k(t) = e(t) \tilde{k}^\ast = e(t) \left(\frac{\gamma }{\delta+g+n} \right) ^{1/(1-\alpha)}h $$ 

- Since `\(\tilde{k}^\ast\)` is constant at the steady state, `\(k\)` at the steady state grows at the same rate as `\(e\)`: `\(g\)`.

### Comparative statics
Capital-technology ratio at the steady state:
$$ \tilde{k}^{\ast} = \left(\frac{\gamma }{\delta+g+n} \right) ^{1/(1-\alpha)}h $$ 
Output-technology ratio at the steady state:

$$ \tilde{y}^{\ast}= \left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta+g+n} \right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}h$$


- `\(\tilde{k}^\ast\)` and `\(\tilde{y}^\ast\)` are rising with investment rate `\(\gamma\)`, and human capital `\(h\)`, 

- `\(\tilde{k}^\ast\)` and `\(\tilde{y}^\ast\)` are declining with depreciation rate, `\(\delta\)`, population growth rate, `\(n\)`, and rate of technological progress, `\(g\)`.

### Increasing the investment rate
As `\(\gamma \uparrow\)`, `\(\tilde{k}^{\ast} =\left(\frac{\gamma }{\delta+g+n} \right) ^{1/(1-\alpha)} h \uparrow\)`, 
`\(\tilde{y}^{\ast}= \left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta+g+n} \right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}h \uparrow\)`

### Effects of an increase in investment rate


&lt;br&gt;


**Short-run:**

- Growth rates of capital per worker and income per worker increase.

- Capital per worker and income per worker increases.

** Long-run (steady-state):**

- Capital per worker and income per worker increase.

- Growth rate of capital per worker and income per worker do not change.

### Exogenous Growth Model

&lt;br&gt;


- Technology is the only source of long-run growth.

- Technological progress is exogenous: not a result of interactions of agents in the model

- Hence, the extended Solow model is an example of  _exogenous growth models._

- It is also referred as _Neo-classical growth model_

- In upcoming lectures, we will analyze _endogenous growth models_

 - Technological progress as a result of actions of model agents.

### Recall: Relative Growth Rates, Predictions


&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

- If two countries have the same rate of investment but different levels of income, the country with lower income will have higher growth.

- If two countries have the same level of income but different rates of investment, then the country with a higher rate of investment will have higher growth.

- A country that raises its level of investment will experience an increase in its rate of income growth.

### Convergence

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


- Are _poor_ countries growing faster than _rich_ countries?

- Are _poor_ countries _closing the gap_?

- **Converge:** The phenomenon of _poor_ countries catching up with the _rich_ countries.

- [Dev Patel, Justin Sandefur and Arvind Subramanian](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/everything-you-know-about-cross-country-convergence-now-wrong) show that countries do converge after 1995.

- Regress growth rate on initial level of GDP per capita 

$$ \frac{\ln y_t - \ln y_0}{t} = \alpha + \beta \ln y_0 + \epsilon $$ 

- Repeat regression with different intial years (results on the right)

### Convergence (?)

- How do we reconcile the converge in OECD but lack of convergence for the world?

-  Prediction of the Solow model:

 - Among the countries with the same steady state, poor countries should grow faster than rich countries.

-  Steady state depends on investment rate, population growth rate, technological progress rate

- OECD countries show similarities in investment rate, population growth rate, rate of technological progress. 

- More variation in the World in these statistics.

### Summary


- There is no long-run economic growth in the Solow model

 - Capital accumulation in the short run generates transitional growth
 
 - GDP per capita is constant in the long run

- We developed a model in which technological progress is the only source of long-run growth

 - Economies grow at the same rate of technological progress in the long run

- We looked at the convergence of countries: 

 - countries with similar steady states converge (conditional convergence) 
 
 - but not all countries.

- Most recent data actually show (unconditional) convergence .
