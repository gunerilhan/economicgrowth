### Two-country model of technology creation and growth

- Draws on Barro and Sala-i Martin (1997)

- Two countries: country 1 and country 2 

`$$y_1 = A_1(1-\gamma_{A,1})$$`
`$$y_2 = A_2(1-\gamma_{A,2})$$`

- Two means of acquiring a technology

 - **Innovation:** the invention of a new technology
 
 - **Imitation:** copying of a technology from elsewhere, available only to _technology follower_
 
- Suppose, country 1 is the **technology leader:** `\(A_1&gt;A_2\)` 

- Country 2 is the **technology follower:** `\(A_1 &gt; A_2\)` 
 
- Assume `\(\gamma_{A,1}&gt;\gamma_{A,2}\)`

 - This assumption along with equal labor force sizes guarantees that country 1 is the technology leader in the model's steady state.


---

### Productivity growth rates
- Productivity growth rate in the leader country
`$$\hat{A}_1 = \frac{\gamma_{A,1}}{\mu_i}L_1,$$` where `\(\mu_i\)` is the cost of _invention_.

- Productivity growth rate in the follower
`$$\hat{A}_2 = \frac{\gamma_{A,2}}{\mu_c} L_2,$$` 
where `\(\mu_c\)` is  cost of _copying_ (or _imitation_)


---

### Cost of copying for the follower country

.pull-left[
- Cost of _copying_ is a function of technology gap between leader and follower:
$$ \mu_c = c\left(\frac{A_1}{A_2} \right) $$

- As technology gap widens, cost of copying decreases

- As `\(\frac{A_1}{A_2} \rightarrow \infty\)`,  `\(\mu_c = c\left(\frac{A_1}{A_2} \right) \rightarrow 0\)`

### Steady State in the Two-Country Model

.pull-left[

- If `\(A_1/A_2 =1\)`, then cost of invention would be the same, and country 1 will grow faster since `\(\gamma_{A,1}&gt;\gamma_{A,2}\)`

- If  `\(A_1/A_2 =\infty\)`, then cost of copying would be 0 for country 2, and it will grow much faster than country 1

- At some point `\(1&lt;A_1/A_2&lt;\infty\)` the countries will grow at the same rate

-  Steady state is stable: 

 - If `\(A_1/A_2 &gt; (A_1/A_2)_{ss}\)`, `\(A_2\)` will grow faster and `\(A_1/A_2 \downarrow\)`

 - If `\(A_1/A_2 &lt; (A_1/A_2)_{ss}\)`, `\(A_1\)` will grow faster and `\(A_1/A_2 \uparrow\)`

]

.pull-right[
- Remember that `\(\hat{A}_2 = \frac{\gamma_{A,2}}{\mu_c} L_2,\)`  `\(\mu_c\)` `\(\downarrow\)` as `\(A_1/A_2\)` `\(\uparrow\)`

&lt;/center&gt;

]

---

### Steady state 


- In the steady state, countries grow at the same rate
`$$\frac{\gamma_{A,1}}{\mu_i}L = \hat{A}_1 = \hat{A}_2 = \frac{\gamma_{A,2}}{\mu_c}L$$`
- Cost of copying:
`$$\mu_c = \frac{\gamma_{A,2}}{\gamma_{A,1}}\mu_i$$`
- Country 2 has lower cost of technology acquisition

- Once we know `\(\mu_c\)`, we can solve for `\(A_1/A_2\)` s.t. `\(c(A_1/A_2)=\mu_c= \frac{\gamma_{A,2}}{\gamma_{A,1}}\mu_i\)`

- Is the technology-leading country necessarily better off than the follower?


---

### Effects of an increase in R&amp;D in the follower country &lt;br&gt; on the steady state

.pull-left[
- Increase `\(\gamma_{A,2}\)` but still lower than `\(\gamma_{A,1}\)`

- Technology level of the follower country come closer to the technology level of the leader country

- Since  `\(\gamma_{A,2} &lt; \gamma_{A,1}\)`, `\(A_1&gt;A_2\)` in the long run

### Effect of an increase in `\(\gamma_{A,2}\)` on productivity and output

&lt;img src="./files/figure5b.jpg" width=75%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

]

- Increase in `\(\gamma_{A,2}\)` causes a temporary increase in growth rates, in contrast to permanent increase in one-country model
 - Similar to increase in investment rate in the Solow model

- In contrast, an increase in `\(\gamma_{A,1}\)` leads to permanent changes in the growth rates

### Technology production function

.pull-left[
- So far, we assumed technology growth rate is independent of current technology level:
$$ \hat{A} = \frac{L_A}{\mu} $$

- However, technology is cumulative: 

 - Researchers begin their investigations where those who came before them left off.

- Considering the increse in the research efforts, growth should have skyrocketed.

### Cumulative nature of technology development

Instead of assuming `\(\hat{A} = \frac{L_A}{\mu}\)` assume `\(\hat{A}\equiv \frac{\dot{A}}{A}= \frac{L_A^\lambda}{\mu}A^{\phi - 1}\)`, then 

$$ \dot{A} =  \frac{L_A^\lambda}{\mu}A^{\phi} $$


- If `\(\phi &gt; 0:\)` **standing on shoulders**

 Isaac Newton: 
 &gt; If I have seen farther than others, it is because I have stood on _the shoulders of giants_.

 - Larger base of knowledge

 - Larger set of tools

- If `\(\phi &lt; 0:\)` **fishing out**

 - Fishing out effect: easiest discoveries have already been made

 - More is known today, more effort for a researcher to learn everything required

---
### Stepping on toes effect

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


- If `\(\lambda &lt; 1\)` 

- Efforts of most of the researchers will be wasted if many are working at the same project

 - Charles Darwin came up earlier with _natural selection_ than Alfred Wallace

 - Two teams completed the sequencing of human genome simultaneously


---
### Long-run growth rate

- How do we calculate long-run economic growth if `\(\dot{A} = \frac{L_A^\lambda}{\mu}A^\phi\)` ?

- Growth rate of `\(A\)`, `\(g_A \equiv \frac{\dot{A}}{A} =  \frac{(\gamma_A L)^\lambda}{\mu}A^{\phi-1} = \frac{(\gamma_A L)^\lambda}{\mu A^{1-\phi}}\)`

- For `\(g_A\)` to be constant in the long run, `\((\gamma_A L)^\lambda\)`  and `\(\mu A^{1-\phi}\)` should grow at the same rate.

- Growth rate of `\((\gamma_A L)^\lambda\)`  is `\(\lambda n\)`, where `\(n\)` is the population growth rate.

- Growth rate of `\(\mu A^{1-\phi}\)` is equal to `\((1-\phi)g_A\)`

- `\((1-\phi)g_A = \lambda n\)`

- Growth rate of technology:   `\(g_A = \frac{ \lambda n}{(1-\phi)}\)` if `\(\phi&lt;1\)`.

- `\(g_A\)` is positively correlated with `\(\lambda\)` and `\(n\)`, and negatively correlated with `\(\phi\)`


---

### Determinants of productivity growth in the long run

Recall that `\(g_A \equiv \frac{\dot{A}}{A} =  \frac{(\gamma_A L)^\lambda}{\mu}\frac{A^{\phi}}{A}\)` and `\(\dot{A} =  \frac{(\gamma_A L)^\lambda}{\mu}A^{\phi}\)` 

In the long-run: `\(g_A = \frac{ \lambda n}{(1-\phi)}\)`

To understand the intuition, suppose `\(\lambda=1\)` and `\(\phi=0\)`

Then `\(g_A =\frac{(\gamma_A L)}{\mu}\frac{1}{A}\)` all the time, `\(g_A = n\)` in the long run

- If population does not grow, `\(g_A\)` will converge to 0

 - Recall `\(\dot{A} =  \frac{\gamma_A L}{\mu}\)` if `\(\lambda=1\)` and `\(\phi=0\)`

- Hence the only source of growth is from population growth

- `\(g_A = n\)` if `\(\lambda = 1\)` and `\(\phi=0\)` 

- Larger population generates more ideas

- Since ideas are non-rivalrous, everyone benefits

---
### Determinants of productivity growth in the long run, cont'd

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

- Now suppose `\(\lambda=1\)` and `\(\phi=1\)`

- Then, `\(g_A =  \frac{(\gamma_A L)}{\mu}\frac{A}{A} = \frac{(\gamma_A L)}{\mu}\)` all the time

- Notice that this formulation is equivalent to our assumption in the last lecture

- We see sustained growth even if research effor is contant, i.e. even if `\(\gamma_A L\)` is constant.

- Rejected by the data

---
### Determinants of productivity growth in the long run, cont'd (2)


If `\(\phi&gt;0\)` but `\(\phi&lt;1\)`:

- still positive spillovers from research

`\(g_A =  \frac{(\gamma_A L)^\lambda}{\mu}\frac{A^{\phi}}{A}\)` all the time

`\(g_A\)` at the steady state (or balanced growth path): `\(g_A = \frac{ \lambda n}{(1-\phi)}\)`

- Unaffected by the fraction of population engaging in R&amp;D

 - Intuitively, higher `\(\gamma_A\)` leads to higher `\(\hat{A}\)` in the short run
 
 - In the long-run, because of diminishing marginal product of idea stock in idea creation, `\(\gamma_A\)` does not affect the long-run economic growth.

However, short-run growth rate of productivity is a still function of fraction of labor force engaging in R&amp;D.

---
### Income per capita in the long run

&lt;br&gt;

- Fraction of labor force engaging in R&amp;D impacts income per capita

 - Positively: high level of productivity in the long run

 - Negatively: smaller fraction of workers in the production

- Size of labor force, `\(L(t)\)`, impacts income per capita positively (**scale effect**):

 - **demand effect:** `\(L \uparrow\)` `\(\Rightarrow\)` larger market for an idea `\(\Rightarrow\)` `\(\uparrow\)` return to research
 
 - **supply effect:** `\(L \uparrow\)` `\(\Rightarrow\)` more potential creators of ideas

### 2-models of innovation

.pull-left[
#### Romer Model

- Developed by Paul Romer

- Technological progress in Romer: 

 - increase in the number of differentiated intermediate goods

 - steam engines and electric motors are used alongside each other

- To produce a differentiated intermediate good, 

 - one needs to own the blueprints of production
 
- Monopolistic competition in the intermediate goods

 - Economic profit is the motive to innovate
]

.pull-right[
#### Schumpeterian model

- Developed by Aghion and Howitt (1992) and Grossman and Helpman (1991)

- Insights of Joseph Schumpeter, creative destruction

- Technological progress in the Schumpeterian model:

 - Technological progress: an innovation replaces an existing intermediate good
 
 - Walking `\(\rightarrow\)` horse cart `\(\rightarrow\)` the Model T Ford `\(\rightarrow\)` modern cars
 
 - Hence the term **creative destruction**

]
---
### What motivates entrepreneurs to innovate?


Return to innovation: expected discounted sum of future profits

Fraction of labor force working in R&amp;D depends

- negatively on the distcount rate

 - the lower the value of future consumption, the lower the incentive to give up current consumption to have higher future consumption

- positively on the probability of innovation
 
 - The higher the chance of a successful innovation, the higher the incentives to innovate

- Negatively on the probability of innovation

 - The higher the chance of being replaced by subsequent innovators, the lower the incentives to innovate 
 
 - Notice that this motive is missing in the Romer model.


---
### Comparison of the Romer model and the Schumpeterian model

- In both models, long-run **growth** is independent of the fraction of labor force engaging in research

- In both models, **level** of income per capita in the long run is impacted by the fraction of labor force engaging in research

- If the discount rate applied to monopoly profits is large, the Schumpeterian model imply a larger fraction of labor force engaging in innovation

 - because relative importance of being replaced by others is small

- If the discount rate is relatively small, the Schumpeterian model imply a smaller fraction of labor force engaging in research

 - because people are sensitive to the future destruction of profits

---
### Socially optimal R&amp;D

 Because of the externalities in the innovation process, competitive equilibrium R&amp;D level is not socially optimal.


Three distortions:

Remember that `\(\dot{A} = \frac{L_A}{\mu} A^\phi\)`


- if `\(\phi &gt; 0:\)` "standing on shoulders"

 - Researchers do not benefit from the positive impact on the subsequent innovators

- if `\(\lambda &lt; 1:\)` "stepping on toes"

 - Researchers do not take into account potential duplication of research efforts

- Consumer surplus effect

 - Private gain of an innovation = profit &lt; Consumer surplus = Social gain 

- Ground for government interference to correct for the externalities

---
### Summary

- Analyzed the technology growth rates of different countries are interrelated.

- Analyzed how current level of technology, and number of researchers determine rate of technological progress.

- Analyzed the motives of innovation

- Analyzed the consequences of innovation
