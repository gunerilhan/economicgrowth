### The Romer Model
- Developed by Paul Romer

- Expanding-variety type of innovation

 - An innovation is an introduction of a new intermediate input in the market
 
 - E.g. introduction of phone, mobile phones, smart phones, foldable smart phones,...

]

.pull-right[
### The Schumpeterian model

- Insights of Joseph Schumpeter

 - Creative destruction: existing firms/technologies are replaced by new and better firms/technologies

- Developed by Aghion and Howitt (1992) and Grossman and Helpman (1991)

- Quality-ladder type of innovation:

 - Horse cart is replaced by Ford Model T, which is replaced by modern cars
]

- In both models to produce a new intermediate input, one needs to own the blueprints of production

 - Ownership of bluebrints of productions brings in monopoly profits
 
- Blueprints are produced by researchers and sold to monopolists 

 - Reason to do R&amp;D

---

### Determination of the fraction of labor force working in R&amp;D 

Return to innovation: expected discounted sum of future profits

--

Fraction of labor force working in R&amp;D depends

- positively on the growth rate of the economy

 - fast growing profits incentivizes inventions

--

- negatively on the discount rate

 - high discount rate means future consumption is valued less

 - the lower the value of future consumption, the lower the incentive to give up current consumption to have higher future consumption `\(\Rightarrow\)` lower incentives to innovate
 

--

- positively on the probability of innovation
 
 - The higher the chance of a successful innovation, the higher the incentives to innovate

--

- negatively on the probability of innovation

 - The higher the chance of being replaced by subsequent inventors, the lower the incentives to innovate 
 - Notice that this motive is missing in the Romer model.


---
### The fraction of labor force working in R&amp;D and economic growth?

- Assuming the idea production is of the form:  `\(\dot{A} = \frac{(\gamma_AL)^\lambda}{\mu}A^\phi\)`, where  `\(0&lt;\phi&lt;1\)`. `\(\Rightarrow g_A\equiv\frac{\dot{A}}{A} =\frac{(\gamma_AL)^\lambda}{\mu}\frac{A^\phi}{A}.\)`
 
- An increase in `\(\gamma_A\)` leads higher rate of technological progress in the short-run, which leads to economic growth.

- Long-run growth rate is independent of the fraction of labor force engaging in innovation.

 - `\(\dot{A} = \frac{(\gamma_AL)^\lambda}{\mu}A^\phi \Rightarrow \frac{\dot{A}}{A} =\frac{(\gamma_AL)^\lambda}{\mu}\frac{A^\phi}{A}\)` 
 
 - (+) Larger `\(\gamma_A\)` makes idea creation easier, and boosts economic growth
 
 - (-) Higher level `\(A\)` makes it harder to achieve same growth rate
 
 - Net effect: long-run growth rate of technology (and output per worker) is independent of the fraction of labor force engaging in innovation if `\(\phi&lt;1\)`
 
- In this regard, the analysis is similar to an increase in the investment rate in the Solow model.

### Insights from the Romer model and the Schumpeterian model


- In both models, long-run **growth rate** is independent of the fraction of labor force engaging in research
 
 - Consistent with the empirical evidence.

--

- The **level** of income per capita in the long run is impacted by the fraction of labor force engaging in research

--

- A larger population size leads to higher levels of income per capita in the long-run. Due to non-rivalrous nature of ideas
 
 - Larger population, more inventors, higher levels of technology
 
 - Larger population, larger market for inventions, more inventors, higher levels of  technology
--

- Long-run economic growth rate is positively related to population growth rate

 - Higher population growth rate generates steady increase in the number of researchers
 
 - Higher rates of economic growth

---
### Insights, cont'd

- Long-run economic growth rate is positively related to knowledge spillovers, `\(\phi\)`

 - If current research benefits future researchers more, the economy can achieve higher economic growth rates

- If the discount rate applied to monopoly profits is large, the Schumpeterian model imply a larger fraction of labor force engaging in innovation

 - because relative importance of being replaced by others is small

- If the discount rate is relatively small, the Schumpeterian model imply a smaller fraction of labor force engaging in research

 - because people are sensitive to the future destruction of profits

---
### Socially optimal R&amp;D

Because of the externalities in the innovation process, competitive equilibrium R&amp;D level is not socially optimal. Remember that `\(\dot{A} = \frac{L_A^\lambda}{\mu} A^\phi\)`


- if `\(\phi &gt; 0:\)` "standing on shoulders"

 - Current researchers do not financially benefit from the positive impact of their inventions on the subsequent inventors

 - leads to under-invesment in R&amp;D in the market economy
--

- if `\(\lambda &lt; 1:\)` "stepping on toes"

 - Researchers do not take into account potential duplication of research efforts
 
 - leads to over-invesment in R&amp;D in the market economy

--

- Consumer surplus effect

 - Private gain of an innovation = profit &lt; Consumer surplus = Social gain 
 
 - leads to under-invesment in R&amp;D in the market economy

---

### Socially optimal R&amp;D, cont'd


- Also, specific to the Schumpeterian model:

 - Inventors steal markets from existing producers
 
 - _Business stealing effect:_ Innovators do not internalize the cost they impose on incumbent producers
 
 - Leads to over-investment in innovation
 
 
- Overall,
 - markets under-invests in innovation
 - Lucking, Bloom, and Van Reenen (2018) estimate that, in the US &lt;br&gt;
 -social returns to R&amp;D in the United States are about 60 percent &lt;br&gt;
 -private returns are about 15 percent


- Ground for government interference to correct for the externalities

- Anti-trust policy should take into account the contrasting effects of market power on the economu:

 - in standard markets, monopolies involve deadweight losses, hence inefficient
 - to provide incentive to innovate, markets need to be imperfect

## Efficiency

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---

### Efficiency

&lt;br&gt;

 Productivity = Technology `\(\times\)` Efficiency 

- Technology: Knowledge about how factors of production can be combined to produce output

- Efficiency: How effectively given technology and factors of production actually used

- Productivity is much lower in poor countries than in rich countries

 - Not obvious the only reason is a gap of technology

 - Many of the most advanced technologies are being used in poor countries

---

### Types of Inefficiency

&lt;br&gt;

- Poor management practices

- Unproductive activities

- Idle resources

- Misallocation among sectors

- Misallocation among firms

- Technology blocking

---
### Management practices

.pull-left[
- [World Management Survery](http://worldmanagementsurvey.org) (Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2017))

- Survey of thousands of managers across 40 countries

- Core management practices:
 - setting sensible targets
 - providing proper incentives
 - credibly monitoring performance 

- Read the [op-ed](https://voxdev.org/topic/firms-trade/management-and-wealth-nations) on the article

- Bloom, Lemos, Sadun, Scur, Van Reenen (2014):
&gt; 'about a quarter of cross-country and within-country TFP gaps can be accounted for by management practices.'

.pull-left[
### Unproductive Activities

- Illegal activities: theft, smuggling, kidnapping for ransom, ..

- Rent seeking: involve the use of laws or government institutions to bring private benefits

 - Economic rent: payment to a factor of production in excess of what is required to elicit the supply of that factor

 - E.g.: quotas to limit the imports of some goods, lobbying, ...

 - Costs: a good deal of effort, bright people work in unproductive activities

]

--
.pull-right[
### Idle Resources


- Factors of production not used at all

- Unemployment, underemployment

- Factory that sits unused

- Factory running at less than full capacity

- Example: In 2001, 
 - Air Afrique: 500 employees per airplane, 
 - EasyJet: 66 employees per airplane
 
- Example: _Firemen_ employed in diesel engines of the United States and Canada railroads during the middle of the 20th century 



]

### Misallocation Among Sectors

.pull-left[
**Misallocation among sectors:** marginal product of inputs are not equal across sectors

- barriers to mobility

 - geographical isolation

 - wage policy: e.g. sectoral minimum wage

 - market segmentation: potentially productive people are unable to work
in certain sectors (due to licensing requirements for example)

 - tax rate differences across industries 
 

- wages `\(\neq\)` marginal product of labor

### Efficiency Gains from Sectoral Reallocation

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Reallocation from agriculture to manufacturing

 - Taiwan: 0.7% of 5.4% annual growth over 1966-1991

 - Korea: 0.7% of 5.7% annual growth over 1960-1990

 - US: fraction of agricultural labor decreased from 50% to 3% over 1880-1980 

 - China: fraction of agricultural labor decreased from 69% to 40% over 1980-2009

---

### Misallocation Among Firms

&lt;br&gt;

**Misallocation among firms:** marginal product of inputs are not equal across firms

- government-owned firms over-employ: political power 

- monopolies under-employ: monopolistic profit

- financial frictions prevent efficient allocation of capital

- discrimination 

 - preventing many talented women, ethnic minorities, and others from working on jobs that better suits their talents.


---
### Technology Blocking




&lt;br&gt;

Agents deliberately prevent the use of technology

- Gutenberg's printing press (1453): scribes 

- automated weaving loom (19th century): Luddites 

- margarine (late 19th century): dairy farmers 

- Netscape browser: Microsoft



---
### Isn't technological progress beneficial to the economy?



- creative destruction and technology blocking

 - the success of technology blocking depends on the relative power of the opposer/supporter

### Long-run growth rate

- How do we calculate long-run economic growth if `\(\dot{A} = \frac{L_A^\lambda}{\mu}A^\phi\)` ?

- Growth rate of `\(A\)`, `\(g_A \equiv \frac{\dot{A}}{A} =  \frac{(\gamma_A L)^\lambda}{\mu}A^{\phi-1} = \frac{(\gamma_A L)^\lambda}{\mu A^{1-\phi}}\)`

- For `\(g_A\)` to be constant in the long run, `\((\gamma_A L)^\lambda\)`  and `\(\mu A^{1-\phi}\)` should grow at the same rate.

- Growth rate of `\((\gamma_A L)^\lambda\)`  is `\(\lambda n\)`, where `\(n\)` is the population growth rate.

- Growth rate of `\(\mu A^{1-\phi}\)` is equal to `\((1-\phi)g_A\)`

- `\((1-\phi)g_A = \lambda n\)`

- Growth rate of technology:   `\(g_A = \frac{ \lambda n}{(1-\phi)}\)` if `\(\phi&lt;1\)`.

- `\(g_A\)` is positively correlated with `\(\lambda\)`, `\(n\)`, and `\(\phi\)`


---

### Determinants of productivity growth in the long run


In the long-run: `\(g_A = \frac{ \lambda n}{(1-\phi)}\)`

To understand the intuition, suppose `\(\lambda=1\)` and `\(\phi=0\)`

Then `\(g_A =\frac{(\gamma_A L)}{\mu}\frac{1}{A}\)` all the time, `\(g_A = n\)` in the long run

- If population does not grow, `\(g_A\)` will converge to 0

 - Recall `\(\dot{A} =  \frac{\gamma_A L}{\mu}\)` if `\(\lambda=1\)` and `\(\phi=0\)`

- Hence the only source of growth is from population growth

- `\(g_A = n\)` if `\(\lambda = 1\)` and `\(\phi=0\)` 

- Larger population generates more ideas

- Since ideas are non-rivalrous, everyone benefits

---
### Determinants of productivity growth in the long run, cont'd

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

- Now suppose `\(\lambda=1\)` and `\(\phi=1\)`

- Then, `\(g_A =  \frac{(\gamma_A L)}{\mu}\frac{A}{A} = \frac{(\gamma_A L)}{\mu}\)` all the time

- Notice that this formulation is equivalent to our assumption in the last lecture

- We see sustained growth even if research effor is contant, i.e. even if `\(\gamma_A L\)` is constant.

- Rejected by the data

---
### Determinants of productivity growth in the long run, cont'd (2)


If `\(\phi&gt;0\)` but `\(\phi&lt;1\)`:

- still positive spillovers from research

`\(g_A =  \frac{(\gamma_A L)^\lambda}{\mu}\frac{A^{\phi}}{A}\)` all the time

`\(g_A\)` at the steady state (or balanced growth path): `\(g_A = \frac{ \lambda n}{(1-\phi)}\)`

- Unaffected by the fraction of population engaging in R&amp;D

 - Intuitively, higher `\(\gamma_A\)` leads to higher `\(\hat{A}\)` in the short run
 
 - In the long-run, because of diminishing marginal product of idea stock in idea creation, `\(\gamma_A\)` does not affect the long-run economic growth.

However, short-run growth rate of productivity is a still function of fraction of labor force engaging in R&amp;D.

---
### Income per capita in the long run

&lt;br&gt;

- Fraction of labor force engaging in R&amp;D impacts income per capita

 - Positively: high level of productivity in the long run

 - Negatively: smaller fraction of workers in the production

- Size of labor force, `\(L(t)\)`, impacts income per capita positively (**scale effect**):

 - **demand effect:** `\(L \uparrow\)` `\(\Rightarrow\)` larger market for an idea `\(\Rightarrow\)` `\(\uparrow\)` return to research
 
 - **supply effect:** `\(L \uparrow\)` `\(\Rightarrow\)` more potential creators of ideas
