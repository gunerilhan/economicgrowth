##Introduction

<br>

* So far, we have focused on average level of income in a country

* In this lecture, we will investigate how income is divided among the residents of a country (distribution of income)

* In 2005, average income in India ($2,2557) was 21% larger than that of Pakistan ($2,112)

* Fraction of the population living on income of less than $1.25 per day

 * 41.6% in India
 
 * 22.5% in Pakistan

* Distribution of income matters as well as average income.

##Overview

<br>

<br>

* Income inequality: the facts

 * Top income shares vs Gini coefficient
 
 * Market income vs disposable income
 
 * Within country inequality vs global inequality

* Sources of income inequality

* Effect of income inequality on economic growth



---
##Distribution of Income

<br>

<br>

<br>
* Divide population into several equal sized groups and measure how much each group earns

* Divide population into different categories of income and look at the fraction of the population in each

In 2009,

* mean income $67,979

* median income $49,777 

* Distribution is skewed, it has very long right tail

## Measuring Inequality ##

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


* Top income shares

 * Share of total income going to top earners

* Gini coefficient

 * Derived from the Lorenz curve


---
##Measuring Inequality, Lorenz Curve

<br>

* Arrange households from lowest to highest income

* Calculate the fraction of the total income earned by the poorest 1 percent

* Then, fraction of the total income earned by the poorest 2 percent

* So on

* Graph these data 

* The more bowed out is the Lorenz Curve, the more unequally income is distributed.

##Measuring Inequality, Gini coefficient
<br>

* Gini coefficient: the area between the Lorenz Curve and the line of perfect equality divided by the total area under the line of perfect equality

* Perfect equality: Gini coefficient = 0 (or 0%)

* Perfect inequality: Gini coefficient = 1 (or 100%)

* The closer is the coefficient to zero, the more income is distributed equally in a country

* Gini coefficient in the US: .468 (or 46.8%)

* Gini coefficient in the UK: .34 (or 34 %) (in 2014, World Bank)

## Market income inequality versus disposable income inequality ##

* Market income:

 * Labor income
 
 * Capital income
 
* Disposable income (income that reaches people's pockets):

 * Labor income
 
 * Capital income
 
 * Transfers (e.g. social security)
 
 * Minus taxes

## Within country inequality versus global income inequality ##

* So far we focused on with country inequality

 * Evidence that inequlity increases in many countries over the last decaded.
 
 * Disposable income inequality measured with Gini coeffienct increased in 15 out of 17 OECD countries (with available data) (Milanovic (2018), [OECD (2015)](http://www.oecd.org/social/in-it-together-why-less-inequality-benefits-all-9789264235120-en.htm)) 
 
* Global income inequality

 * Income inequality among all the people in the world
 
 * Declined in the last decades
 
 * Gini in 2003: .687, Gini in 2013: .649 ( Tomáš Hellebrandt and Paolo Mauro (2015))

## Income inequality and <br> economic growth ##

---
##The Kuznets Curve

Simon Kuzents' hypothesis (1955): as a country develops, inequality should first rise and then fall

##Kuznets Curve

<br>

<br>


* The data in Figure 13.5 does not provide strong evidence of the inverted U-shape relationship between development and income inequality

* Some researchers (Barro for example) argue that once you control for other factors that affect inequality, the inverted U-shape is observed.




---
##Sources of Income Inequality
<br>

Why is there income inequality?

Characteristics that effect income

* ownership of physical capital: inheritance, investment

* human capital: health, education

* occupation specific skills/talent: leadership, artistic skills, language skills etc.

* geography/location: where you live

* matching of characteristics with economic environment



---
##Education as the Source of Income Inequality

* lower return to education reduces income inequality

 * the earning difference between the poor and the rich decreases 

* narrower distribution of years of education reduces income inequality

 * the fraction of middle income workers increases




---
##Explaining the Kuznets Curve

* Technological progress raises the returns to skills (education, entrepreneurial ability) 

 * marginal product of human capital increases 
 * skilled workers earn more
 * income inequality increases

* Technological progress raises return to physical capital

 * Technologies are often embedded in new capital goods
 * Skills and capital are found at the higher end of distribution
 * Inequality rises

* Resource reallocation gradually takes place

 * unskilled workers increasingly value education given the widened wage gap
 * workers flow into fast-growing regions/industries
 * As technological progress slows down, return to physical capital decreases
 * income inequality decreases

##Explaining the Recent Rise in Income Inequality

* Technological progress

 * rise of information technology: return on education should rise
 * Skill-biased technological change

* Increases in international trade

 * demand for internationally scarce resources: return on education should rise
 * owners of internationally scarce resources benefit

* Superstar dynamic 

 * people with the highest levels of some qualities earn much more than people with only slightly lower qualifications
 * sports, entertainment

* Government policies (deregulation, tax policy, etc)

##Effect of Income Inequality on Economic Growth
Inequality leads to high capital accumulation

* rich people have a higher saving rate than poor people
* the greater proportion of income earned by the rich the higher the national savings rate
* greater income inequality leads to higher income per capita via physical capital accumulation

If a country is open to flows international capital flows

* Investment does not need to be financed by domestic savings
* Effects of inequality on physical capital accumulation will be diminished

##Effect of Income Inequality on Economic Growth, cont'd ##
Inequality leads to low human capital accumulation

* Human capital is installed in a specific person

 * marginal return decreases as human capital increases

* Physical capital can be rented to other people

 * marginal return does not depend on a person's investment

---
##Effects of Inequality on Human Capital Accumulation

* Poor people invest mainly in human education
* After one point, the rich stop investing in human capital
* Gini coefficient for physical capital in the US: .78
* Gini coefficient for years of education: .14
* If income is taken from the poor and given to rich

 * The poor decreases human capital
 * The rich do not invest in human capital
 * Total human capital decreases
 * Income decreases

* If a country is open to flows international capital flows

 * effects of inequality on human capital remain




---
##Income Inequality, Income Redistribution, and Efficiency
Redistributionary taxes leads to distortion

 * progressive tax charges higher tax rates on the more productive worker 
 * income tax discourages labor: inefficiency (dead-weight loss) increases 
 * greater income inequality leads to lower income per capita


There are counter arguments about this point.



---
##Empirical Evidence

<br>

Available data is not sufficient to estimate the individual effects of inequality on growth

* no evidence that countries with higher income inequality has higher capital stock accumulation

* in countries where income inequality is higher the level of education is lower (matches predictions of this chapter)

* no evidence that higher income inequality leads to more redistributive taxation
