## Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ##

**GDP:** Market value of all the goods and services produced in a country within a period. 

- GDP = output = income

- GDP is a rough-and-ready measure of standard of living. 

- How to compare GDP of countries with different currencies and of a single country in different years?

 -  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates: artificial exchange rates based on the prices of a standardized basket of goods and services (both traded and non-traded).

---

## GDP per capita##
GDP per capita = average income

$$ y_t = \frac{\text{total GDP}}{\text{population}} $$

- Total GDP could be large because of high average income and/or large population

- US has high GDP per capita but China and India do not

### Fact 1



- Per capita income in the poorest countries are less than 5% of per capita income in the richest countries.

- GDP per capita in 2016 (in 2011 US dollars)

$$ \frac{\text{US (\$53015)}}{\text{Iran (\$15529)}} \approx \frac{\text{Iran (\$15529)}}{\text{Moldova (\$5851)}} \approx \frac{\text{Moldova (\$5851)}}{\text{Ethiopia (\$1659)}} \approx 3 $$


- The 20% of world population that lives in the richest countries receive 60% of world income.
