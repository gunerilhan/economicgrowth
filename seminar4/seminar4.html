### Questions

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;



1. According to [Chad Jones (2017)](https://voxeu.org/article/new-ideas-about-new-ideas-paul-romer-nobel-laureate), what new ideas did Romer bring about new ideas?

2. In what key aspects does the Romer's endogenous growth model differ from Solow's exogenous growth model?

## How are ideas different than goods?

### Ideas 

- are non-rivalrous

 - not depleted by use
 
 - technologically possible to be used by any number of people at a time
 
- Leads to increasing returns to scale

 - production with rivalrous goods and ideas together exhibit increasing returns

- Necessitates imperfect competition

### Technological change

is a result of efforts by 

- researchers

- entrepreneurs

- inventors

who respond to economic incentives such as 

- tax policy,

- research funding,

- education policy,

- intellectual property rights.

With these policies one can potentially impact economic growth.

### Justifications for government involvement in innovation market?

- Knowledge spillovers

 - Other firms can copy and learn from the original research
 
 - "Even with a well-designed intellectual property system, the benefits of new ideas are difficult to monetize in full."
 
 - Marginal social benefit of innovation is greater than marginal private benefit of innovation
 
 - In the market economy, there is too little innovation
 
- Product market spillovers

 - _Business-stealing_ effect
 
 - "Inventor firms may steal market share from other firms without necessarily generating any social benefit."
 
 - In the market economy, there is too much innovation

---
### Social returns to R&amp;D
 
 
&gt; "As a whole, this literature on spillovers has consistently estimated that social returns to R&amp;D are much higher than private returns, which provides a justificatin for government policy."


Lucking, Bloom, and Van Reenen (2018) estimate that, in the US 

- social returns to R&amp;D in the United States are about 60 percent

- private returns are about 15 percent

### Why not just give property rights to inventors

- Patents have efficiency loss

 - enables firms to have high markups
 
- Other firms can invent around patents

---

### Failures in other markets

&lt;br&gt;

- Financial constraints limit innovation

- Since intellectual property is intangible, it's harder to use it as collateral 

- Equity financing has challenges:

 - You cannot reveal your innovative idea before you actually patent it
 
 - You cannot get funding if you don't explain your idea

### What are the main policy tools to promote innovation? 

1. Tax incentives

2. Patent boxes

3. Human capital supply

4. Intellectual property

5. Product market competition and international trade

6. Targeting small firms

7. Moonshots

### Summary of results

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="./files/table2.jpg" width="60%"/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


---
### Tax incentives

- Elasticity of R&amp;D with respect to tax-price of R&amp;D is about 1.

Concerns:

- relabelling existing expenditure as R&amp;D
 
 - patenting and productivity also increases after tax credits 
  
- relocation of R&amp;D different locations to take advantage of tax credits

 - some evidence of relocation
 
 - relocation in itself does not account for all the increase in R&amp;D

&lt;br&gt;


&gt; "Overall, the conclusion from this literature is that despite some relocation across place, the aggregate effect of tax credits at the national level both on the volume of R&amp;D and on productivity is substantial."
---
### Patent boxes

&lt;br&gt;

**Patent box:** lower tax on revenues linked to patents as opposed to other revenues

- Used in 16 OECD countries as of 2017

- Firms can manipulate stated revenues from patents

- Choi (2019): 'such policies do not have on the real location or the quantity of either R&amp;D or innovation'

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "In contrast to well-designed research and development tax credits &amp;ndash; for which it is hard to manipulate the stated location of research labs &amp;ndash; patent boxes should be discouraged."

---

### Government research grants

- Harder to target R&amp;D tax credits to maximize social benefit

- Target basic R&amp;D

- Potential crowding out of private R&amp;D

- Or adds in to private R&amp;D spending (crowd-in)

- Jacob and Lefgren (2011): grants produce positive but small effects on research output

- Other researchers: public R&amp;D crowds in private R&amp;D

- Positive impact of academic R&amp;D on corporate patenting

- Government funding of own labs

---

### Human Capital Supply

&gt; "Increasing the quantity of innovative activity requires increasing the supply of workers with human capital needed to carry out research, as emphasized by Romer (2001)" 

- Increase the number of individuals with STEM degrees
 - Bianchi and Giorcelli (2018): change in enrollment requirements in Italy `\(\rightarrow\)` `\(\uparrow\)` STEM graduates `\(\rightarrow\)` more innovation
- Migration
 - Immigrants in the US make up 18 percent of the labor force over age 25
 - Immigrants constitute 26 percents of STEM workforce
 - Immigrrants own 28 percent of higher-quality patents

&gt; "Overall, most of the available evidence suggests that increasing the supply of human capital through expanded university programs and/or relaxed immigration rules is likely to be an effective innovation policy."

- Bell et al. (2019): children born into top 1 percent income distribution is 10 times as likely to be an inventor than children born into bottom half.
 - differences in innate ability explain only a little of the discrepency
 - differentiated exposure to inventors in childhood
 - better schooling, greater exposure to inventor role models, mentoring needed
 
---

### Intellectual property

- Patents, copyrights, trademarks, ...

&gt; "A patent grants &amp;ndash; in exchange for disclosure of invention &amp;ndash; a limited-term property right to an inventor, during which time the inventor has the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling their invention."

- Boldrin and Levine (2013) argue that patent system should be abolished
 - no evidence that patents increase innvation and productivity
 
- Social costs might be greater than social benefits

- Patent trolls

---

### Product market competition and international trade

Theoretical impact of competition on innovation is ambiguous.

- Competition reduces innovation
 - The reward to innovation is monopoly profits. 
 
 - Competition reduces profits and hence incentives to innovate.
 
 - Also reduces funds to finance innovation.
 
- Competition increases innovation

 - Monopolists have no incentive to innovate
 
 - An entrant has no rents to lose, so it can engage in destructive innovation
 
 - If competition reduces demand for a firm's products, it will be forced to innovate

---
### Competition
 
- Empirical evidence suggests that competition increases innovation, especially in markets with low level of competition

 - In South America, Asia and Europe, competition from China increased innovation

 - In North America, competition from China reduced innovation in manufacturing

- Increase innovation by increasing the market size

&gt; "Greater competition and trade opennes typically increase innovation."
