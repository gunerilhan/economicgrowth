### 2-models of innovation

.pull-left[
#### Romer Model

- Developed by Paul Romer

- Technological progress in Romer: 

 - increase in the number of differentiated intermediate goods

 - steam engines and electric motors are used alongside each other

- To produce a differentiated intermediate good, 

 - one needs to own the blueprints of production
 
- Monopolistic competition in the intermediate goods

 - Main motive to innovate: expected discounted sum of future profits
 ]

.pull-right[
#### Schumpeterian model

- Developed by Aghion and Howitt (1992) and Grossman and Helpman (1991)

- Insights of Joseph Schumpeter, creative destruction

- Technological progress in the Schumpeterian model:

 - Technological progress: an innovation replaces an existing intermediate good
 
 - Walking $\rightarrow$ horse cart $\rightarrow$ the Model T Ford $\rightarrow$ modern cars
 
 - Hence the term **creative destruction**

]

### What motivates entrepreneurs to innovate?

Return to innovation: expected discounted sum of future profits

In equilibrium: expected return to innovation is equal to return on working in the production sector = wage rate

---

### Fraction of labor force working in R&D 

Fraction of labor force working in R&D depends

- negatively on the discount rate

 - high discount rate means future consumption is valued less

 - the lower the value of future consumption, the lower the incentive to give up current consumption to have higher future consumption
 
 - lower incentives to innovate

--

- positively on the probability of innovation
 
 - The higher the chance of a successful innovation, the higher the incentives to innovate

--
- negatively on the probability of innovation

 - The higher the chance of being replaced by subsequent innovators, the lower the incentives to innovate 
 
 - Notice that this motive is missing in the Romer model.

---
### Comparison of the Romer model and the Schumpeterian model

<br>

- In both models, long-run **growth** is independent of the fraction of labor force engaging in research


 - Remember: $\dot{A} = \frac{L_A^\lambda}{\mu}A^\phi$, and assume $\phi<1$
 
 - Diminishing marginal product of ideas in idea production
 
- In both models, **level** of income per capita in the long run is impacted by the fraction of labor force engaging in research

- If the discount rate applied to monopoly profits is large, the Schumpeterian model imply a larger fraction of labor force engaging in innovation

 - because relative importance of being replaced by others is small

- If the discount rate is relatively small, the Schumpeterian model imply a smaller fraction of labor force engaging in research

 - because people are sensitive to the future destruction of profits

---
### Socially optimal R&D

 Because of the externalities in the innovation process, competitive equilibrium R&D level is not socially optimal.


Three distortions:

Remember that $\dot{A} = \frac{L_A^\lambda}{\mu} A^\phi$


- if $\phi > 0:$ "standing on shoulders"

 - Researchers do not benefit from the positive impact on the subsequent innovators

--

- if $\lambda < 1:$ "stepping on toes"

 - Researchers do not take into account potential duplication of research efforts

--

- Consumer surplus effect

 - Private gain of an innovation = profit < Consumer surplus = Social gain 

---

### Socially optimal R&D, cont'd

- Ground for government interference to correct for the externalities

- Also, specific to the Schumpeterian model:

- _Business stealing effect:_ Innovators do not internalize the cost they impose on incumbent producers

- Notice that, 

 - in standard markets, monopolies involve deadweight losses, hence inefficient
 
 - to provide incentive to innovate, markets need to be imperfect

## Efficiency

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px></html>


---

### Efficiency

<br>

 Productivity = Technology $\times$ Efficiency 

- Technology: Knowledge about how factors of production can be combined to produce output

- Efficiency: How effectively given technology and factors of production actually used

- Productivity is much lower in poor countries than in rich countries

- Not obvious the only reason is a gap of technology

- Many of the most advanced technologies are being used in poor countries

---

### Types of Inefficiency

<br>


- Unproductive activities

- Idle resources

- Misallocation among sectors

- Misallocation among firms

- Technology blocking

---

### Unproductive Activities

<br>

- Illegal activities: theft, smuggling, kidnapping for ransom, ..

- Rent seeking: involve the use of laws or government institutions to bring private benefits

 - Economic rent: payment to a factor of production in excess of what is required to elicit the supply of that factor

 - E.g.: quotas to limit the imports of some goods, lobbying, ...

 - Costs: a good deal of effort, bright people work in unproductive activities


---

### Idle Resources


<br>

- Factors of production not used at all

- Unemployment, underemployment

- Factory that sits unused

- Factory running at less than full capacity

- Example: In 2001, 
 - Air Afrique: 500 employees per airplane, 
 - EasyJet: 66 employees per airplane
 
- Example: _Firemen_ employed in diesel engines of the United States and Canada railroads during the middle of the 20th century 


---

### Misallocation Among Sectors

<br>

**Misallocation among sectors:** marginal product of inputs are not equal across sectors

- barriers to mobility

 - geographical isolation

 - wage policy: e.g. sectoral minimum wage

- wages $\neq$ marginal product of labor

 - market segmentation: potentially productive people are unable to work
in certain sectors

---

### Efficiency Gains from Sectoral Reallocation

<br>

<br>

Reallocation from agriculture to manufacture

 - Taiwan: 0.7% of 5.4% annual growth over 1966-1991

 - Korea: 0.7% of 5.7% annual growth over 1960-1990

 - US: fraction of agricultural labor decreased from 50% to 3% over 1880-1980 

 - China: fraction of agricultural labor decreased from 69% to 40% over 1980-2009

---

### Misallocation Among Firms

<br>

<br>

**Misallocation among firms:** marginal product of inputs are not equal across firms

- government-owned firms over-employ: political power 

- monopolies under-employ: monopolistic profit

- financial frictions prevent efficient allocation of capital


---
### Technology Blocking

<br>

<br>

Agents deliberately prevent the use of technology

- Gutenberg's printing press (1453): scribes 

- automated weaving loom (19th century): Luddites 

- margarine (late 19th century): dairy farmers 

- Netscape browser: Microsoft

### Isn't technological progress beneficial to the economy?

<br>

- creative destruction and technology blocking

 - the success of technology blocking depends on the relative power of the opposer/supporter

- rich countries are more prone to technology blocking

- technology blocking requires a well functioning government

- Analyzed the motives of innovation

- Analyzed externalities in the innovation process, and justified the role of government intervention
