### 2-models of innovation

.pull-left[
#### Romer Model

- Developed by Paul Romer

- Technological progress in Romer: 

 - increase in the number of differentiated intermediate goods

 - steam engines and electric motors are used alongside each other

- To produce a differentiated intermediate good, 

 - one needs to own the blueprints of production
 
- Monopolistic competition in the intermediate goods

 - Main motive to innovate: expected discounted sum of future profits
 ]

.pull-right[
#### Schumpeterian model

- Developed by Aghion and Howitt (1992) and Grossman and Helpman (1991)

- Insights of Joseph Schumpeter, creative destruction

- Technological progress in the Schumpeterian model:

 - Technological progress: an innovation replaces an existing intermediate good
 
 - Walking `\(\rightarrow\)` horse cart `\(\rightarrow\)` the Model T Ford `\(\rightarrow\)` modern cars
 
 - Hence the term **creative destruction**

]
---
### What motivates entrepreneurs to innovate?

Return to innovation: expected discounted sum of future profits

In equilibrium: expected return to innovation is equal to return on working in the production sector = wage rate

---

### Fraction of labor force working in R&amp;D 

Fraction of labor force working in R&amp;D depends

- negatively on the discount rate

 - high discount rate means future consumption is valued less

 - the lower the value of future consumption, the lower the incentive to give up current consumption to have higher future consumption
 
 - lower incentives to innovate

--

- positively on the probability of innovation
 
 - The higher the chance of a successful innovation, the higher the incentives to innovate

--
- negatively on the probability of innovation

 - The higher the chance of being replaced by subsequent innovators, the lower the incentives to innovate 
 
 - Notice that this motive is missing in the Romer model.

---
### Comparison of the Romer model and the Schumpeterian model

&lt;br&gt;

- In both models, long-run **growth** is independent of the fraction of labor force engaging in research


 - Remember: `\(\dot{A} = \frac{L_A^\lambda}{\mu}A^\phi\)`, and assume `\(\phi&lt;1\)`
 
 - Diminishing marginal product of ideas in idea production
 
- In both models, **level** of income per capita in the long run is impacted by the fraction of labor force engaging in research

- If the discount rate applied to monopoly profits is large, the Schumpeterian model imply a larger fraction of labor force engaging in innovation

 - because relative importance of being replaced by others is small

- If the discount rate is relatively small, the Schumpeterian model imply a smaller fraction of labor force engaging in research

 - because people are sensitive to the future destruction of profits

---
### Socially optimal R&amp;D

 Because of the externalities in the innovation process, competitive equilibrium R&amp;D level is not socially optimal.


Three distortions:

Remember that `\(\dot{A} = \frac{L_A^\lambda}{\mu} A^\phi\)`


- if `\(\phi &gt; 0:\)` "standing on shoulders"

 - Researchers do not benefit from the positive impact on the subsequent innovators

--

- if `\(\lambda &lt; 1:\)` "stepping on toes"

 - Researchers do not take into account potential duplication of research efforts

--

- Consumer surplus effect

 - Private gain of an innovation = profit &lt; Consumer surplus = Social gain 

---

### Socially optimal R&amp;D, cont'd

- Ground for government interference to correct for the externalities

- Also, specific to the Schumpeterian model:

- _Business stealing effect:_ Innovators do not internalize the cost they impose on incumbent producers

- Notice that, 

 - in standard markets, monopolies involve deadweight losses, hence inefficient
 
 - to provide incentive to innovate, markets need to be imperfect

### Interesting podcast episodes/video clips related to our lecture

&lt;br&gt;

#### Solo climbing to El Capitan and knowledge spillovers

The indicator from Planet Money: 
[The Economic Lessons Of A Free Solo Climb ](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/02/811280651/the-economic-lessons-of-a-free-solo-climb)

&lt;br&gt;

#### Where does innovation come from?

Prof. Stefanie Stancheva explains her [research](https://voxeu.org/content/where-does-innovation-come?) on the importance of interactions of innovators in deriving innovation and economic growth.

## Efficiency

&lt;html&gt;&lt;div style='float:left'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=796px&gt;&lt;/html&gt;


---

### Efficiency

&lt;br&gt;

 Productivity = Technology `\(\times\)` Efficiency 

- Technology: Knowledge about how factors of production can be combined to produce output

- Efficiency: How effectively given technology and factors of production actually used

- Productivity is much lower in poor countries than in rich countries

- Not obvious the only reason is a gap of technology

- Many of the most advanced technologies are being used in poor countries

---

### Types of Inefficiency

&lt;br&gt;


- Unproductive activities

- Idle resources

- Misallocation among sectors

- Misallocation among firms

- Technology blocking

---

### Unproductive Activities

&lt;br&gt;

- Illegal activities: theft, smuggling, kidnapping for ransom, ..

- Rent seeking: involve the use of laws or government institutions to bring private benefits

 - Economic rent: payment to a factor of production in excess of what is required to elicit the supply of that factor

 - E.g.: quotas to limit the imports of some goods, lobbying, ...

 - Costs: a good deal of effort, bright people work in unproductive activities


---

### Idle Resources


&lt;br&gt;

- Factors of production not used at all

- Unemployment, underemployment

- Factory that sits unused

- Factory running at less than full capacity

- Example: In 2001, 
 - Air Afrique: 500 employees per airplane, 
 - EasyJet: 66 employees per airplane
 
- Example: _Firemen_ employed in diesel engines of the United States and Canada railroads during the middle of the 20th century 


---

### Misallocation Among Sectors

&lt;br&gt;

**Misallocation among sectors:** marginal product of inputs are not equal across sectors

- barriers to mobility

 - geographical isolation

 - wage policy: e.g. sectoral minimum wage

- wages `\(\neq\)` marginal product of labor

 - market segmentation: potentially productive people are unable to work
in certain sectors

---

### Efficiency Gains from Sectoral Reallocation

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Reallocation from agriculture to manufacture

 - Taiwan: 0.7% of 5.4% annual growth over 1966-1991

 - Korea: 0.7% of 5.7% annual growth over 1960-1990

 - US: fraction of agricultural labor decreased from 50% to 3% over 1880-1980 

 - China: fraction of agricultural labor decreased from 69% to 40% over 1980-2009

---

### Misallocation Among Firms

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

**Misallocation among firms:** marginal product of inputs are not equal across firms

- government-owned firms over-employ: political power 

- monopolies under-employ: monopolistic profit

- financial frictions prevent efficient allocation of capital


---
### Technology Blocking

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Agents deliberately prevent the use of technology

- Gutenberg's printing press (1453): scribes 

- automated weaving loom (19th century): Luddites 

- margarine (late 19th century): dairy farmers 

- Netscape browser: Microsoft

---
### Isn't technological progress beneficial to the economy?

&lt;br&gt;

- creative destruction and technology blocking

 - the success of technology blocking depends on the relative power of the opposer/supporter

- rich countries are more prone to technology blocking

- technology blocking requires a well functioning government
---
### Summary

- Analyzed the motives of innovation

- Analyzed externalities in the innovation process, and justified the role of government intervention
