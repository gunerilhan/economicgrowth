### Questions

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

### Population growth rate and GDP per capita

.pull-left[
- There is a negative correlation between population growth rate and GDP per capita

- Countries like The Democratic Republic of the Congo (COD) have high population growth rate and very low GDP per capita

- India and China how moderate population growth rate and middle income per capita 

- Germany, the US, the UK have low population growth rates but high income per capita

- How about Qatar (QAT)?

 - Immigration?

### Population growth in the Solow model

.pull-left[

- Law of motion for capital per worker
$$ \dot{ k} = \gamma f(k) - (\delta+n)k,  $$where `\(n\)` is the population growth rate.

- At the steady state
$$  \gamma f(k^{\ast}) = (\delta+n) k^{\ast}  $$
- As `\(n \uparrow\)`, `\(k^{\ast}\downarrow\)` (from `\(k_1^{ss}\)` to `\(k_2^{ss}\)`)
 - Notice that both `\(k^\ast\)` and `\(k^{ss}\)` mean steady-state capital per worker.

 
- Countries with high population growth are poorer.

- Higher population growth dilutes per-worker capital stock more quickly

- Lower steady state level of output per worker

### Exercise

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

- Sketch a graph of (log of) capital per worker and output per worker over time with and without a decrease in the population growth rate.


---
### Solow model's predictions of income differences

- Recall income per worker of country `\(i\)` relative to the country `\(j\)`,

$$ \frac{y_i^{\ast}}{y_j^{\ast}}= \left(\frac{A_i}{A_j}\right)^{1/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{\gamma_i}{\gamma_j}\right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{\delta_j+n_j}{\delta_i+n_i}\right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{h_i}{h_j}\right)$$
- Remember that in the Solow model income per worker ratio is equal to income per capita ratio as everyone works.

- Suppose country `\(i\)` and country `\(j\)` differ only with respect to their population growth rates and `\(\alpha=1/3.\)`

  `\(A_i=A_j=A\)`, `\(\delta_i=\delta_j=\delta=0.05\)`, `\(h_i=h_j=h\)`, and `\(\gamma_i=\gamma_j=\gamma\)`.

- Then,


$$ \frac{y_i^{\ast}}{y_j^{\ast}}= \left(\frac{0.05+n_j}{0.05+n_i}\right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}$$



---

### Solow model's predictions vs data

.pull-left[
- If country `\(i\)` and `\(j\)` differ only with respect to their population growth rates

- Substitute in average population growth rates from 1970 and 2019, and calculate actual and predicted income per capita ratios relative to the US.

- There is still a positive correlation but not very strong.

- We did not take into account:

 - Differences in investment rates
 - Differences in human capital
 - Differences in productivity
 - Employment growth rate is not equal to population growth rate in the data in cotrast to the model

### What's the unrealistic critical assumption of the Solow model in regards to population growth rate?

 - Constant population growth rate assumption of the model
 
 - Population growth rate is decreasing throughout the world
  - As countries get richer, fertility rate tends to decrease.

.pull-right[
- Lower population growth rate leads to aging of the society
 
- Working age population/total population goes down
 
- GDP per capita  = GDP per worker `\(\times\)` `\(\frac{Employment}{Population}\)`

- A reduction in `\(\frac{Employment}{Population}\)` pushes down GDP per capita growth.

- The second factor, which is very important, is assumed away in the Solow model.

]

---
### Summary

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;



Solow Model

- Accounts for the negative correlation of population growth rate and income per capita

 - higher population growth rate dilutes capital quickly, and hence countries cannot accumulate as much capital per worker

- Population growth rate is exogenous

- Cannot account for the reduction in population growth rate as countries get richer

Reduction in the population growth push down GDP per capita growth.

### Quality of labor

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;br&gt;


- So far, we have mostly treated quality of labor as same across countries and over time.

- Quality of labor that a worker supplies depends on whether the worker is 

 - weak or strong
 
 - ill or healthy
 
 - ignorant or educated

.pull-left[
### Human Capital

**Human capital:** Qualities of labor that

- are productive (characteristics that enable workers to produce more),

- are produced (investment in human capital),

- earns a return (higher wage for owners of human capital),

- depreciates.


Human capital can be 

- in the form of health,

- in the form of education.

### Measuring human capital

#### How do we put a value on `\(h\)` in the production fucntion `\(y=Ak^\alpha h^{1-\alpha}\)`?

&lt;br&gt;



Human capital = 
- A weighted average years of education

 - returns to education in each year of schooling are used as weights 

- Click for [details](#measure)
---
### Quantitative analysis

- Recall income per worker of country `\(i\)` relative to the country `\(j\)`,

$$ \frac{y_i^{\ast}}{y_j^{\ast}}= \left(\frac{A_i}{A_j}\right)^{1/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{\gamma_i}{\gamma_j}\right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{\delta_j+n_j}{\delta_i+n_i}\right)^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{h_i}{h_j}\right)$$

- Suppose country `\(i\)` and country `\(j\)` differ only with respect to their human capital

`$$A_i=A_j=A, \text{ } \delta_i=\delta_j=\delta,\text{ } n_i=n_j=n, \text{ and } \gamma_i=\gamma_j=\gamma$$`.

- Then `$$\frac{y_i^{\ast}}{y_j^{\ast}}= \frac{h_i}{h_j}$$`

- If we measure human capital, we can calculate income differences predicted by human capital differences using the above equation

### Solow model's predictions vs data

.pull-left[

- Substitute in human capital levels in 2019 into `$$\frac{y_i^{\ast}}{y_j^{\ast}}= \frac{h_i}{h_j}$$`

- Compute predicted income per worker ratio relative to the US for each country

- Compare predicted values with actual values from data

 - There is a strong and positive correlation (0.71) between the two
 
- Human capital is a strong predictor of income differences across countries

### Problems in comparing education levels across countries


.pull-left[
- quality of schooling might be different across countries

 - high income countries tend to have ''better" schooling

 - average years of schooling understates the difference in human capital

- externalities

 - human capital could affect technology and efficiency levels 

 - private return vs social return of education

- Human capital in the form of health and education have positive effects on income.

- High income countries have higher years of schooling, and higher schooling quality.

- Years of schooling and quality of schooling have been improving all around the world.

### Measuring human capital

&lt;br&gt;


#### How can we measure human capital in a country?

1. Measure the value of spending one more year in school in different education levels

2. Characterize the distribution of years of schooling people have in a country

3. Find human capital for different education levels using step 1

4. Combining the 2nd and 3rd steps, generate a human capital index
 - Human capital index is a measure of average human capital in a country

### (Private) returns to education

_Step 1 in measuring human capital_

.pull-left[
- **Returns to education:** Increase in wages that a worker would receive if she had one more year of schooling.

 - a measure of spending one more year in school

- Estimates from Hall and Jones (1999)

 - First 4 years (grades 1 &amp;ndash; 4): 13.4%

 - Next four years (grades 5 &amp;ndash; 8): 10.1%

 - Beyond eight years: 6.8%

_Steps 3 and 4 in measuring human capital_

How can we measure human capital in the form of education?
 $$ h = h_0 \times \left(\left( \frac{w_1}{w_0}\right)^{t_1} \times \left( \frac{w_2}{w_1}\right)^{t_2} \times \dots  \right)$$

- `\(h_0:\)` level of labor input per worker with no schooling

- `\(\frac{w_i}{w_{i-1}}:\)` annual wage premium paid to education level `\(i\)` (primary, secondary, higher)

- `\(t_i:\)` years spend in education level `\(i\)`

Then take a weighted mean of worker specific human capital to mesure average human capital in a country:

Example: Percentage of people with primary education times human capital of a worker with primary education, plus percentage of people with high school education times human capital of a worker with high school degree, and so on.

### Human capital's share of wages

&lt;br&gt;


- Wage is paid to the combination of the hours worked (raw labor) and their quality (human capital)

- How much is paid to raw labor?

- How much is paid to human capital?

- Suppose a worker has five years of education.

- His wage would be `\(1.1344^4 \times 1.101 = 1.82\)` times wage of a worker with no education

- `\(0.82/1.82 = 45\%\)` to human capital, `\(55\%\)` to raw labor

- Now, apply this method to entire labor force
