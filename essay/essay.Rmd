### Structure of the essay matters (a lot)! ##

* What is the main message of your essay?

 * Say it clearly in the introduction
 
 * Repeat the main message in the main body and in the conclusion
 
* Structure your essay around the main message

 * Analyze the different aspects of your message
 
 * Support each and every argument you make
 
 

* Cite your references appropriately

Read Economical Writing by Deirdre McCloskey:

The book is available at the library [shelves.](https://librarysearch.kent.ac.uk/client/en_GB/kent/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:1574505/ada?qu=economical+writing&if=el%09edsSelectFacet%09FT1&ir=Both)

Some quotes from the book:

- "The one genuine rule, a golden one, is Be Clear."

 - "If the reader thinks what you write is unclear, then it is, by definition."
 
- "So What?"
 
 - "Answer that question in every sentence, and you will become a great scholar, or a millionaire; answer it once or twice in a ten-page paper, and you'll write a good one"

### Economical Writing by Deirdre McCloskey:

- "Paragraphs should have points"

 - "The paragraph should be a more or less complete discussion of one point."

- "Make your writing cohere"

 - "The reader can understand writing that hangs together, from phrases up to entire books. She cannot understand writing filled with irrelevancies."
 
- "Be concrete" and "be plain"

- "Speak to an audience of human beings"

 - "Choose a reader and stick with her. Changing your implied reader is in an economic sense inefficient."

- "Avoid boilerplate" 
 
 - "Get to the point that some skeptical but serious reader cares about and stick to it."
