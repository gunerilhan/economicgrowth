###  DICE model

ECONOMIC GROWTH, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND CLIMATE CHANGE

by The Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel:

> 1. a carbon-circulation model that maps emissions of fossil carbon to a path for atmospheric carbon-dioxide (CO2) concentration

> 2. a climate model that describes the evolution of the climate over time depending on the path of CO2 concentration

> 3. an economic model that describes how the economy and the society is affected by climate change over time, and – closing the loop – how the path of economic activity leads to emissions of fossil carbon.

###  Climate Change ⇒ ?? Climate-change policies ?? ###

** Why do we need climate-change policies? **

Because of market failures

- Climate change is a public bad
  
  - Non-rival (everyone will lose from it)
  
  - Non-excludable (one cannot exclude themselves from the negative effects)
  
  - Free-rider problem: if a country keeps producing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but the rest of world reduces the emissions, that country will be better off without paying any costs
 
- Negative externality

 - negative impact of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on others
 
 * global: emissions by people in one country have negative impacts on residents of far away countries
 
 * long-run: emissions today have negative impact on future generations

---
### Other factors

- Potential tipping point problem:

 - if the increase in global temperatures exceeds a point, it might be impossible to reverse the climate change
 - low probability but catastrophic event
 - necessitates prudential policies

### Design of optimal policies ###

.pull-left[

- People get utility from consumption

- They maximize discounted sum of utility from future consumption

 - subject to resource constraints: reductions CO<sub>2</sub> emissions require sacrifices from consumption
 
 - if CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is not reduced, the future consumption will be negatively affected.
 
- Question: **how do you reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions most efficiently (with limited cost)?**

 - Models help us answer this question.

### Modeling decisions ###

* Discount factor 
* Weight on the welfare of future generations
 * Positive
 * Normative

* Households do not derive utility from the welfare of other households 

 * How much weight should be put on the welfare of different regions?

* Policy implementation
 
 * carbon tax
 
 * tradable carbon emission permit

### Alternative policies ###

<br>

* Business as usual (minimal policies)

* Cost-benefit optimum (two damage functions)

* Limit temperature increase (to 1.5 , 2, 2.5 °C) with hard cap

* Limit temperature increase (to 1.5 , 2, 2.5 °C) over 100-year or 200-year averaging period

Source: Nobel Committee

- Carbon taxes disincentivize carbon-intensive production and consumption

* Carbon tax should be set equal to the social cost

- An increasing carbon tax is the most efficient way to coordinate economic activity

 - Needs coordination of economic activity by billions of people
 
- Carbon taxes incentivizes innovation in green technologies
---
### Political economy ###

- Diverse group of countries/people with different incentives

* Pareto optimal allocation requires compensation of losers

* Free rider problem

* Proposal by Nordhaus
 
 * Form a climate club 
 * Target carbon price, say $50 per ton CO2
 * Penalty tariff on non-participants, say 3% uniform

* Without cooperation, equilibrium tax would much lower than the optimal tax

* Incentives for innovation
